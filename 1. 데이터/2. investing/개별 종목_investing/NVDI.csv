That was most of what I have. I hate this. | First Last - you are right! One penny off new record highs. Tomorrow first thing. | &quot;Happy spending&quot; and &quot;red hot PPI - great headings for tomorrow. Everything will fall but maybe retailers? Hmm. | This toktok ban is bs. Same as the Huwei scam. A bunch of old Republicans whose VCRs are flashing 12:00 worried about tech they don't understand. | shiba | In 2022, these overpriced tech stocks dumped 50% of their value in a matter of months due to rising inflation. Best of luck holding these P/Es that are near 100 as inflation goes back up and rate drop chances are now virtually zero. | Oh look, it's another intraday miracle &quot;recovery&quot; in the US FRAUD Market.  Can't have a day without a &quot;record high, &quot; can we?  Of course not, not in the BIGGEST INVESTMENT JOKE IN THE WORLD. | Retail numbers seem engineered to cause a rally tomorrow.

Have you looked at copper? The Inflation Reelection Act is in full swing! | BofA Securities' prize targets turned out to be wrong so they changing the targets. They will change again after they turn out to be wrong also. But maybe they will be right eventually. | Ath later today with no reason. | Why should FED wait? Many believe that data points are wrong and inflation is really under control. So cut rates now. | New data points won't matter as investors who don't want to miss out will continue to buy. | What mix ??? When us 30 is up ???? | 10AM breaker fires predictably as ever.  Flagrant enough for ya?  The manipulation will continue until the DOW hits 40K, then the rug comes out, and wipes out the retirement hopes of millions, as average holdings in 401K's get averaged up into the stratosphere.  Nothing but &quot;rallies&quot; and &quot;record highs&quot; in the greatest financial FRAUD in history, and BIGGEST INVESTMENT JOKE IN THE WORLD. | Ignore reality. Buy when everyone is gredy. | Quit worring about expected value the expert can guess right anyway, watch the YOY trend in CPI which was down from January and has either decreased or remained flat for the last 17 months.
