Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,2024-05-17,Just appoint Nvidia to replace everyone in the Fed and AI as the next US Prez | These United States of America will come together on the resolution between party lines. Deal incoming. Sea of green to boot. GO TECH! GO NVDA! | inflation rises again....fed is sleepy... | Please do not publish any news of Debt Ceiling Negotiation. It has been going on for ever.Biden cut short his G7 Japan visit so he can work on the debt ceiling negotiation. Since then 12 days has passed still no outcome. I am so bored of hearing about debt ceiling. Day after day - no outcome.,MRVL
Marvell CEO Matthew Murphy sells $2.08 million in company stock,2024-05-16,"vote for biden, we live in fear of nuclear war. vote for trump, they live in fear of nuclear war. seems pretty clear. god bless americaüá∫üá∏ | The FED started raising rates too late. There was too much cash available at extremely low rates for too long. I think they are trying to hold back the markets as long as they can before they have to pivot. Right now I'm staying diversified using the trending algorithmic system, and having monitored the performance netting over 120k (18%) in four months, I have learned why only a few make enormous returns from the seemingly complicated markets. | Bidenomics are working. | Still hoping that rate hikes are ending even after the FED said one more hike possibly two. Once they do stop there will be a plateau period of 12-14 months before they start cutting. No recession means no rate cuts. | Chips stock rally due to Intel lowered worse than previous year result?",MRVL
Marvell COO sells over $340k in company stock,2024-05-16,Yhis is from May. HAS NOTHING to do with today.,MRVL
Marvell technology CFO sells shares worth over $64k,2024-05-01,"Only great news top of the home page during market hours. Bad news posted at the top after market close | just say what it is. momentum and algo trading. this bubble is ready to pop. Every data point is flashing hard recession. buckle up for a crash | with today's move, the S&amp;P 500 is now targeting 4305, if the debt ceiling is resolved... | My heads spinning from the headline! | I love how democrats claim republicans are fascists when democrats have been doing nothing but trying to tear down all the checks and balances. They want to try and allow Biden to unilaterally overturn Congress on the debt ceiling because they are not getting their way. They want to try and expand the Supreme Court because they are not getting their way. They wanted to try and extend the &quot;COVID emergency&quot; to try and allow Biden to unlawfully push student loan forgiveness. They engage in malicious prosecution of political opponents while halting and hiding investigations against fellow democrats. Democrats openly collude with the media while trying to shut down media that provides unfavorable coverage similar to how dictators in North Korea function. The democrat party is the party of fascism and we are all paying the price. Biden has a lot of donors to launder money to and is why he wants to keep with his reckless spending and hyper inflation. | uS cannot default on debt payments. interest is not bigger than income. it can only stop other expenses which are unnecessary anyway | 50bps in June. 6% terminal rate. | TSLA long‚Ä¶. cant lose.

GM Recognizes Marvell With 2023 Overdrive Award For Its Automotive Ethernet Technology,2024-04-23,"&quot;Powell signals possible rate hikes....&quot; -- that headline is a bit misleading, Powell only said he wasn't ruling out rate hike in the next Fed meeting (which is reasonable, the next Fed meeting isn't until late July, he shouldn't make any decision before seeing the latest data in July), that's not quite the same as signaling rate hikes..... | The curtain rises on the &quot;late trade&quot; magic show, where losses miraculously vanish into thin air, and criminally manufactured &quot;gains&quot; hold through the close.  Manipulated JOKE. | Just shut this guy up. Now it's done for the day. Duh | tuck it and forget it ..or.. first step of genders anonymous, i am powerless over my gender, my life has become duxmtuxkerxed. | Hunter is calling Jerome | i wouldn't be surprised by 2 50 pts rate hikes.. .getting the terminal around 6%.... | Show must go on... | More predictable FRAUD, as the 11AM breaker fires and the losses vanish into thin air?  Where was the breaker yesterday?  Oh, that's right, criminally manufactured &quot;rallies&quot; are uninhibited. | To lazy to write a real story! | How ridiculous is this?? Powell already started this, repeatedly. At this point, the markets and traders are a joke | Yes,market mixed after news of possible rate hikes lol | Seriously we‚Äôve known this for weeks now move on | Overvalued stocks becoming more overvalued. | what will be the impact on gold according to Powell speach | Old white haired mf‚Äôs im so sick of this shit | What are you smoking? The market pumped nearly 2% yesterday. Inflation YoY is over 5%. He said recently they are planning two upcoming rate hikes. Then he again said they were going to do rate hikes. Hedge funds are just pumping the market with people's 401ks while taking out short positions before the implosion especially with 2024 elections coming up. Might even have Kamala have to take over from demented Joe considering the guy cannot walk without falling, talk without forgetting what he is saying, and is close to being impeached over the crimes revealed through the investigations into his son. | Powell is done raising rates. It is back to TECH AND REAL ESTATE BUBBLES | The NASDAQ fraud continues. | Oh, i heard someone knew about this in DC says the ban is not going to happen | I repeat, stocks don't go down and never will, people buy and hold, never sell, so how can they go down?? | 2YR yield already at 4.75% soon to be 5%, effectively making short term business loans even more expensive. | US stocks led by the made up non verified news pulished by Wall St Journals | Shut this guy up.",MRVL
Marvell Technology Group Ltd receives Investment Bank Analyst Rating Update,2024-05-13,"Well done to all the short sellers. You have played this well. The sea of green cannot be stopped. GO TECH! ayayaya | I am a robot im virtually tea bagging you hehe hehe | I think republicans will use this opportunity to demand for fresh elections. | I googled debt ceiling and the news articles there aren't so optimistic. | I love how the democrats talk about how the republicans are fascists when they have been doing nothing but trying to tear down all the checks and balances. They want to try and allow Biden to unilaterally overturn Congress on the debt ceiling because they are not getting their way. They want to try and expand the Supreme Court because they are not getting their way. They wanted to try and extend the &quot;COVID emergency&quot; to try and allow Biden to unlawfully push student loan forgiveness. They engage in malicious prosecution of pollical opponents while halting and hiding investigations against fellow democrats. The democrat party is the party of fascism and we are all paying the price. Biden has a lot of donors to launder money to and is why he wants to keep with his reckless spending and hyper inflation. | Nothing like hyper-valuation of growth stocks while the country is in massive debt at risk of default and banks are literally crashing with more bank funds have been lost already this year than all of 2008. | Sources say both sides cannot come to an agreement of spending cuts. Negotiation has ended for the day | Marvell only has a few thousand employees and were laying people off. Doesn't seem too solid. | Yes but where are the chips actually made? | What if the debt ceiling deal is at an impasse by the end of the day? | most important data cpi and not a single word.... | here is the thing if any of you has read W.D.Gann then market is going.to crash somewhere in july till then you can hold tight..... | Creating bubbles. Shame on market makers | Market is up 10% over the past 30 days as the country sits on its highest debt level in human history at risk of default while inflation and interest rates are rising. | Was planning to hold into next week but taking profits here. I had bought some long positions for a pump after the debt deal, but they went ahead and pumped this market massively this week so why would I take on unnecessary risk going into next week. Buy the rumor, sell the news. Plus, &quot;Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge accelerated in April&quot; &quot;US consumer spending surges in April; inflation heats up&quot; so expecting Fed to come talk of more rate hikes soon and cause the market to dump. | Excuse me short sellers.. can you say sea of green? ROFL. WE WON! GO TECH! ayayaya | Xauusd sell ??! | red end of day. collapse on Monday | Theres no deal on debt ceiling.. | so silly headline... not interested in focusing on inflation rising",MRVL
Marvell Technology Appoints Rick Wallace and Daniel Durn to its Board,2024-04-29,"Sea of green baby. Plain and simple. | Why is this important for the stock market? | Hopium pump is the nuke üòÜüòÜüòÜ | inflation not to talk about much better rumours | Will McCarthy get his spending cap or that cap just got lifted higher to get the deal done?? All smokes for nowü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | losing üìâ credibility these headlines | Political show and Wall Street is serious about it. Are you serious? At the end of it, deadlock remains. There will be no deal this month for sure | &quot;US debt ceiling talks struggle before deadline; 'major issues'&quot;...oh yes, sounds SOOOO hopeful. | gonna drop like a rock .. | Nsdq 100 up on any hope of anything. No bubble ü§£ü§£ | There will be no deal today. Get over it and accept it. | Hope springs eternal. | Ok Mr. short seller. What happened? What's wrong?! Can't handle the sea of green get yourself out of our kitchen please and LET US COOK! GO TECH! AYAYAYA | Or it if it breaks 14,300, watch for big reversal | Put in ahort here | dylan is back with his name calling and his ignorance.... | Jumps on hopes of avoiding bankruptcy. I think I have seen enough... | Is that the narrative? Doesnt help when biden cant remember what was said the previous day | It is worth noting that in 2023 there have been more funds lost in bank crashes already than the total amount of funds loss due to bank crashes during 2008 recession. Money has been flowing into growth stocks while financial sector is crashing. Let's see how sustainable this is with a presidential election coming up soon and Fed pushing for more interest rate hikes. | A deal doesnt mean it will pass the house and senate. Remember that. | Debt deal made. Now treasury is going to print 600bil papers to replenish its account | Hopium is a strong addictive drug.
