Texas Instruments started at underweight by Wells Fargo on key concerns,2024-05-16,"Boeing slumps? It went up 8%. | A reason why 14 up Dow days not seen since 1897. Keep shorting , next day or two etc‚Ä¶ will see red. Perfect set up for cpi friday | Everythings great til it's oh sheet | Sweet! Cannot wait to buy more high P/E stocks while rates are going up and mortgage rates are going to 10%! I am sure everybody's shrinking savings accounts are going to help the market! | What you shrug off today, weighs tomorrow.",TXN
Wells Fargo starts Texas Instruments stock citing auto/industrial recovery doubts,2024-05-16,"Consumer spending is a key driver of economic growth. | rallies on recession??? | 2605 fraud dude has to practice breathing as to not have a nervous breakdown if market isnt green every day. Sad. | Get a load of that fraud ü§° in the photo. Is he scared it might drop a few cents again? LOL | Hear that sound? That's retail traders with fomo emptying their accounts to buy over- priced stocks. | Thank you Biden for driving the price of energy through the roof, and making everything 20% more expensive in just a few years! | Banks make lots of money we loose‚Ä¶ the crise is very close | Of course, production cuts will tighten oil market. How else can it be? The only recipe against Saudis was a combination of increasing US production and friendlier Russia. Biden has taken care of both options, and Saudis are in complete control now. | Energy is powering ahead at the wrong time. It'll add fuel to inflation, which might translate into tightening. We'll see.",TXN
TI Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi to speak at Bank of America investor conference,2024-05-15,"Lowered revenue, fortune telling free cash flow prediction and a promise future share buyback stocks rally.........a potential üêÇüí© | Pre-market FRAUD well underway in the US Ponzi Scheme, laughingstock of the investing world.",TXN

Texas Instruments chairman Templeton sells shares worth $36.5m,2024-05-03,Strong earning from lowered than previous year earning forecast TXN ...due to AU hype...what a scam joke | why asia rise if american companies give results üòÜ,TXN
Texas Instruments director sells shares worth over $1.8m,2024-05-03,Lower the earning forecast like TXN to beat the forecast . .very effective scam | Where the analysts said Tesla has no growth? Analyst is a job does not have any consequences on what they said.,TXN
Texas Instruments director sells $1.79m in stock,2024-05-01,Why no incentive to produce in USA?,TXN
Texas Instru receives Investment Bank Analyst Rating Update,2024-05-20,"What a pile of manure. | Under Trump, the nation was locked down due to pandemic in 2020. Prior to 2020, deficit was -4.6% of GDP. The pandemic actually ended in 2021. Under Biden in 2022, the deficit was still -5.4% of GDP. | god bless the moms of liberty üá∫üá∏ as bidens presidency collapses under fraudanomics, crime and rampant incompetence. | Check out Lyn Alden's June newsletter on Inflation vs Interest rates. It explains why Fed cannot stop inflation caused by runaway deficit spending, like we have with Bidenomics. | The market, analysts, and investors all come to the same conclusion. Disinflation is here forever!  They just might be wrong.  Being wrong will have massive consequences like a trillion dollar bet gone bad.  We are addicted to disinflation for 40 years. All asset classes are huge bubbles that have been transparent and will be seen once INFLATION takes hold.  WAGES should see a big surprise on the upside soon.  Strikes the likes of which we have not seen since early 70's sets the stage for a vicious cycle.  This market will not withstand 6% on Fed Funds.  IF/when that happens we drop hard and long. | the cartel will eventually fail ...the house of cards never holds longer | FED will print money and distribute.Rate hike are timepass events for the FED. | After the minute, will jump back up, cuz the sharks are buying at low NOW | it is reported US has already reserved lots of gallium just in case | no gallium no chips | Futures and Investors Should Not Be In The Same Sentence. sorry, apples and oranges. | What are the fed minutes going to say that hasn't already been said? I bet there is more opposition to 2 more rate hikes then Jpow wants to admit | The minutes is gonna say: we still have work to do to achieve maximum employment, there would be some hard time in meanwhile. I can pretty remember every single word, and media still making news on that every week, fear this and that, inverted yield curve. Why dont media make news about each period when interest rate went up, the market also moved up as well in past 2 decades?? Who gets the benefit when there is a dip?? | Not sure why the fed is still the story. Maybe they raise rates one or twice but for the most part they're done.",TXN
Texas Instru receives Investment Bank Analyst Rating Update,2024-05-16,Lowered the earning forecast and EPS.......upgrade the stock... churn out deceptive manipulated üêÇüí©bullish prediction.....and the stock will rally,TXN
Texas Instru receives Investment Bank Analyst Rating Update,2024-05-15,"Fortune favors the brave lmfao | The yield curve is closely monitored by investors. | scare tactic | I like how they all think it's about AI somehow completely blind to the fact that after well over a year of one of the worst crashes in 50 years Nasdaq and sp both are rapidly recovering. And sure sox got to climb a lot but it's still not at its peak from 2021 and if you like sox (and soxl) you'll love mamaa (and fngu) everyone is recovering tech is leading because tech is leading since 2011, nothing changed. | don't bet against AI ...",TXN
