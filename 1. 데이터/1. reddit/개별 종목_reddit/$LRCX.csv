25,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",I’ve been researching chip stocks and it’s quite fascinating how important each one of these companies are. With the recent run up from AI it’s been hard to fine the value in each company but I’m curious what everyone else’s insight is.,$LRCX,reddit
26,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",AMAT stands out to me the most at the moment as it’s still a relatively low PE at 23 and it’s dropped 6% the last few days due to ASML and TSMCs earnings. Most of the other manufactures are still around the 30 range or higher but in the long run I’m sure they’re going to be amazing companies.,$LRCX,reddit
27,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",I think the only issue is how much these companies rely on selling to China and how that’s hurting their bottom line quite a bit. Eventually that might change but I think that’s really unlikely for quite a while.,$LRCX,reddit
28,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","ASML and AMAT. ASML is essentially a monopoly chip makers depend on that buys back a ton of shares. Hold it long enough, it will pay off. AMAT is a generalist in semiconductors that does a bit of everything, does it pretty well, and will likely continue to be a resilient key player in the industry because of it.",$LRCX,reddit

30,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","My personal favorite is AMAT. They make the machines that make semiconductors, which the demand for is only growing. They are also not segmented to just one type of chip. They make the equipment needed for both low end chips and high end chips. Contrast this to ASML which has a monopoly on making the piece of equipment needed only in very advanced chips. Additionally AMAT has rewarded their investors in both price appreciation and dividend income, which they have committed to growing their dividend 20%/year for the next for years as of 2023.",$LRCX,reddit
31,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","SMH is probably your safest route to avoid having all your eggs in one basket and being upset if the stock you picked slightly underperforms the others. Lets be honest, stock picking is very emotional with a lot of hindsight biases",$LRCX,reddit
32,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","Thanks for the insight, yeah I’ll probably just go with an ETF, all the companies are better than just one. I really like ASML and AMAT, so why not just get the ETF which has both.",$LRCX,reddit
33,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","They are all about equal. Forward PEs for three in the 20-24 range. ASML is higher and may be a bit more vulnerable to cyclicity because of the gigantic nature of their new device. AMAT has a Justice Department lawsuit pending against them, so if you only wanted one I'd flip a coin between KLAC and LRCX (tho ""klac"" is the one more fun to say)...",$LRCX,reddit

36,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",Gonna research more about KLA though,$LRCX,reddit
37,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",I feel like an ETF would remove the stress of trying to pick one though for sure.,$LRCX,reddit
