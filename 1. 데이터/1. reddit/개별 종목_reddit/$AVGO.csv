Didn’t make it down to 1250, but I bought the dip on the first green candle at 1265 or so. My three 1400 calls for the 28th are up a $1000+ already! Hope the upswing continues.",$AVGO,reddit

At least I have 3 weeks… Averaged down, probably sell off half if the dip gets bought today. At least you have until June, you should at least be able to get out with a little bit less damage. Lot of puts on 1310, so that may take a good push to get past.",$AVGO,reddit
