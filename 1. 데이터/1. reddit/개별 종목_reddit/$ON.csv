1565,"Monday, May 13, 2024 at 5:12:02 PM GMT+9",Simple Sector Rotation Strategy!,"The reason for including PDBC in both offensive and defensive assets stems primarily from the use of TIP as the canary asset. TIP serves as a trigger, particularly in inflationary environments, shifting towards defensive assets. Hence, in a strategy where PDBC is used alongside TIP as a canary, it's crucial to include PDBC in defensive assets. This decision is rooted in the understanding that during periods where both stocks and bonds underperform, PDBC emerges as a top-performing asset, especially in inflationary scenarios. While I agree there might be concerns regarding overfitting, I also acknowledge the validity of this approach. Furthermore, the rationale for including PDBC in the offensive assets is similar to that of the IEF above.",$ON,reddit

1567,"Monday, May 13, 2024 at 5:12:02 PM GMT+9",Simple Sector Rotation Strategy!,"The concern regarding overfitting due to different lookback periods is valid. The rationale behind the longer 11-month lookback on offensive assets is to reflect the slower and longer trend of these assets. Offensive assets, consisting primarily of equities, are expected to exhibit a gradual upward movement, contrasting with the swift market collapses or downturns. On the other hand, the shorter lookback period employed for defensive assets aims to capture the rapid and short-lived nature of market downturns. However, it's worth noting that applying the same 11-month lookback period to defensive assets didn't result in significant differences. You can refer to the table below for details.",$ON,reddit

i am doing a triple boot with gentoo, windows and pop os
I am getting farther at each install, but there is allways an error.
this time it seemed like i finally did it, but when i rebooted, the ethernet cards werent found
i searched and all i had to do was enable some especial modules on the kernel, wich i did
(my ethernet controller is realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit (rev 0c))
but then when i tried running grub-mkconfig the grub folder was missing from boot
even worst, boot wasn't mounting (unknow filesystem type: vfat)
i researched and i had to eselect the kernel, but none appeared in the list
then had to re emerge the gentoo-sources with symlink flag
i saw on a discussion on this forum to just make a grub folder and run mkconfig anyway
but when i rebooted nothing changed, and i also noticed the default kernel appeared at /usr/src
i tried loading my custom kernel through advanced options for gentoo, but the boot freezes at loading ramdisk
when i do grub mkconfig, os prober doesn't recognize the other OSes, even tough they appear on grub menu
can i recover this install?
also what things should i add or remove on my kernel?
i have a Intel Celeron G3930 (2) @ 2.900GHz cpu and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 graphics card
i want use it as a normal day to day computer, do some gaming, programing and browse the internet
i also want my config to be more performance oriented but nothing too crazy since i am a noob at linux",$ON,reddit

I am using Debian 12 and I've tested it with XFCE/KDE and SDDM/LightDM in case the problem was with the window/display manager. When I plug the monitor into the HDMI port nothing seems to happen, except for when I removed Nvidia drivers in which case plugging in the HDMI cable popped up a screen to allow me to select the type of output (mirror/extend) on the second monitor but nothing happens after clicking it and a similar window pops up when using XFCE. The output of xrandr on XFCE shows HDMI-1 as disconnected and the output when using KDE doesn't display it at all. There's nothing appearing in the kernel logs that seems relevant. I also checked acpi_listen and seen the following message appears when I plug HDMI in: video/switchmode VMOD 00000080 00000000, but once again the message only appears when the Nvidia drivers aren't installed and it's using the Nouveau ones. My laptop has 2 graphics cards, one is integrated with the Intel CPU and the other is a Nvidia graphics card. Both graphics card's show up on lshw and lspci and the external graphics card seems to work fine when running glxgears on it. The external card also appears as an HDMI audio output but just shows disconnected constantly.",$ON,reddit

Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides.

Japan has been stuck with this problem since the 1990s because the national bank of Japan has had low interest rates. Until the recent decision to raise the rate to 0.1, it was actually negative, meaning that borrowers would not have to do anything with the loan, pocketing the negative interest. Low interest rates have enabled the rise of zombie companies - companies which do not make a profit, instead making revenue from investment, loans, and government subsidies. The interest rate in Japan is still at rock bottom but it's a sign that the days of zombie companies are waning. It's understandable not to want these companies to fail because when they do, people lose their jobs. But when they do, it frees up capital to be used somewhere else. Imagine if instead of failing, Sears was still a big retailer, surviving because of negative interest rates.",$ON,reddit

You could never dream of funding a new reverse osmosis system or high pressure filters to clean the water, so all your residents have to boil water constantly. This is the reality in a lot of places. All of a sudden these two bills are passed and the feds come into your town and say ""Hey, we'll cover 60% of the cost of this system, the state will chip in 10%. You just have to figure out how to pay for the remaining 30%"". All of a sudden this is way more attainable and these projects are getting built on a massive scale right now. I've personally designed and secured funding for about 8 of these types of projects just in the past 18 months, and there's hundreds of other engineers all doing the same thing right now.

They are making a big mistake,"The shift from globalization to homeland economics is driven by concerns about economic inequality and national security. However, this shift may not benefit the ‚Äúleft-behind‚Äù working class as much as hoped due to the increasing need for higher education and skills in new manufacturing jobs. While there may be some benefits for the global poor, these are likely to be outweighed by the costs. The shift represents a major policy change that could have long-term consequences, and if these policies fail to achieve their objectives, it could lead to even more protectionism and industrial policy. Policymakers face the challenge of finding a balance between addressing these concerns and avoiding the pitfalls of protectionism and industrial policy.

Noone can deny the extremely transformative influence that government leadership has when setting industrial targets due to the historical results. Contemporary examples - such as Taiwan, Japan, China and India make it very clear, that even done messily it can be a net benefit.

I had TLT puts until Monday and sold them for a nice profit, wish I kept them for Tuesday too but oh well. I'm fucking terrified of bear market rallies but that's also why I still have money. 5% on the long end is not the top, it's just a temporary stop even if they go down for a bit. The deficit is around 4% of GDP, there is not even enough discretionary spending to balance the budget anymore, and military/social security/medicare are not going to be cut by a third. The deficits will continue and that means inflation will continue at the same rate since it will all be paid for by issuing debt that will be bought by the money printer. Eventually bond buyers will decide they aren't getting paid enough for inflation and yields will go into a death spiral until we decide to scuttle aircraft carriers and let Gam Gam starve. On top of this no one is buying bonds anymore except speculators, and they're going to eventually have to cover (sell) to end the bleeding. Foreigners are selling either because they need the money (Japan) or they don't want to write off their holdings when they get sanctioned (China). Oil princes also don't need to buy treasuries as much when they aren't selling oil only in dollars anymore. Yes I know bonds are worth less than half of what they were recently, but they can go down another half if yields go up to 7.5% from 5%.",$ON,reddit

That being said, there are points on here that could be arguably avoided rather than considering the reaction and achievement.",$ON,reddit

You would have to acknowledge all of his political history that is not truly great at all. Most people forgot about his infamously botched presidential run where he plagiarized his entire speech and his connections with former KKK members who he referred to as his mentor...,$ON,reddit

The guy you are referring to was, yes, a KKK member for a couple years in his 20s. He then went on to be a US Senator from WV for 51 years. He had been a US Senator for over 12 years when Biden first became a part of our government.",$ON,reddit
