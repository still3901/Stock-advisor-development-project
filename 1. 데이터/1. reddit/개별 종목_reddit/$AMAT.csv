42,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",I’ve been researching chip stocks and it’s quite fascinating how important each one of these companies are. With the recent run up from AI it’s been hard to fine the value in each company but I’m curious what everyone else’s insight is.,$AMAT,reddit
43,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",AMAT stands out to me the most at the moment as it’s still a relatively low PE at 23 and it’s dropped 6% the last few days due to ASML and TSMCs earnings. Most of the other manufactures are still around the 30 range or higher but in the long run I’m sure they’re going to be amazing companies.,$AMAT,reddit
44,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?",I think the only issue is how much these companies rely on selling to China and how that’s hurting their bottom line quite a bit. Eventually that might change but I think that’s really unlikely for quite a while.,$AMAT,reddit
45,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","ASML and AMAT. ASML is essentially a monopoly chip makers depend on that buys back a ton of shares. Hold it long enough, it will pay off. AMAT is a generalist in semiconductors that does a bit of everything, does it pretty well, and will likely continue to be a resilient key player in the industry because of it.",$AMAT,reddit

47,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","My personal favorite is AMAT. They make the machines that make semiconductors, which the demand for is only growing. They are also not segmented to just one type of chip. They make the equipment needed for both low end chips and high end chips. Contrast this to ASML which has a monopoly on making the piece of equipment needed only in very advanced chips. Additionally AMAT has rewarded their investors in both price appreciation and dividend income, which they have committed to growing their dividend 20%/year for the next for years as of 2023.",$AMAT,reddit

50,"Friday, April 19, 2024 at 7:03:12 AM GMT+9","Out of ASML, LRCX, AMAT, and KLA, which is the best in terms of value?","They are all about equal. Forward PEs for three in the 20-24 range. ASML is higher and may be a bit more vulnerable to cyclicity because of the gigantic nature of their new device. AMAT has a Justice Department lawsuit pending against them, so if you only wanted one I'd flip a coin between KLAC and LRCX (tho "klac" is the one more fun to say)...",$AMAT,reddit
