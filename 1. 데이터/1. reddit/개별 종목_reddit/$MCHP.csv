86,"Thursday, January 4, 2024 at 10:13:56 PM GMT+9","Microchip Technologies getting grants to increase production, including a $90M expansion in COS",One of the leading microchip and semiconductor manufacturers in the springs laid off nearly 40 people before the holidays. I'm curious if this will create long term employment for residents or if it will be another quick hire before seasonal lay offs typical for the industry.,$MCHP,reddit

Chip production doesn't have to always be bleeding edge. So much of our devices uses decade old chips to make them run, yet without the production (as shown back in 2021), so many of our everyday devices becomes impossible to manufacture.",$MCHP,reddit

This isn't 1987 lol, nobody in the world has small enough hands to physically make the chips used today. Even using a microscope is too crude. Chips have been made with laser etching for years.",$MCHP,reddit
