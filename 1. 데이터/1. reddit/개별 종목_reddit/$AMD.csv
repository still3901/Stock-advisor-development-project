If not, I apologize and feel free to remove. So I'm a pc gamer and have noticed AMD has been popping off in all aspects. Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD. I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up. These are my current options, it's not much, but I'm a beginner. And before anyone says it, I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why. I'm not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there. My goal is to get some decent chunks of change from AMD's calls and reinvest the profits into actual shares and using the original investment into calls again. Here are my options. The first 3 are cheap yolos that I know have a small chance. The second 2 are the ones I care about and really hoping does well. I feel like I made pretty decent choices.

It's apparently been in development for the past 2 years and AMD is actively ZLUDA 3. It's out right now and it will only get better. Besides the fact Nvidea has a mainstream control of AI, once AMD gets their open source cuda implementation up and running smoothly as equal or even better than Nvideas closed source cuda implentation in the next couple years, won't this just make nvidea stock price drop?

1832,"Friday, May 26, 2023 at 8:32:38 AM GMT+9",Intel drops the bomb on Nvidia and AMD by lowering prices on the A750 to just $199.,"After seeing the disastrous benchmarks for the just released RX7600 (whats the point of this card?) and the 4060 TI (can you imagine how bad the 4060 is going to be based on those results?), AMD panic lowers MSRP just a day before launch and Nvidia shrugs it off completely due to their AI earnings. Enter Intel, who already has a great value budget card with comparable performance to the RX7600, slashes its price to just $199, beating AMD's equivalent card by $70, or 26%. At this point, until AMD lowers prices, Intel owns this segment and its not even close. This is good for consumers, even if you don't plan on buying an A750.

1833,"Friday, May 26, 2023 at 8:32:38 AM GMT+9",Intel drops the bomb on Nvidia and AMD by lowering prices on the A750 to just $199.,"If this is any indication of what's to come, when Intel drops Battlemage, there's going to be a price war and that will only benefit consumers. Intel has publicly stated their intention is to undercut the competition to gain market share (which is what AMD should have been doing all along). As long as Intel can deliver on its intended power target of 4070TI to 4080 levels of performance on its highest tier model, give us a reasonable amount of VRAM (which looking at the A770 16GB appears to be on their to-do list) and does so at competitive prices, then there is light on the horizon for gamers. I know a lot of you are soured on Intel, but this is exactly what we need so please put the swords down for a minute and look at what they're trying to do. We need the competition now more than ever. Having whats essentially a monopoly with a follower company walking the exact same footsteps, that (as well as the crypto booms and covid pricing) is what brought us to where we are today... Not quite on the collapse of PC gaming, but certainly a huge downturn. The high cost of entry for PC gaming vs consoles is why it's suffering and that's largely due to GPU prices, so it's like a light at a really dark 3-4 year tunnel to see prices drop solely based on competition.",$AMD,reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recent games that make use of DX12 DirectStorage and other types of asset streaming started having performance issues like stuttering when moving across open worlds. It wasn't so much PCIE3 itself but that the PCIE3 bandwidth gets shared on the older AM4 motherboards. Later generations of AM4 CPUs are capable of a lot more total PCIE bandwidth and don't run into the same bottleneck that occurs when everything is shared across the 3900MB/s total bandwidth provided by the 4 PCIE3 lanes B350 motherboards had for devices other than the 16X PCIE slot reserved for your GPU.,$AMD,reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That lead to more people buying Nvidia GPU's. On top of that, AMD GPU's have had a very difficult time breaking into the laptop space. Since most people prefer laptops over desktops, and the majority of gaming laptops have Nvidia GPU's, that's a huge dent in the market share.

Ray tracing is still a generation behind Nvidia, but it's also something that really isn't worth dealing with in the first place so it's kind of a moot point. FSR is also a generation behind Nvidia's DLSS, but it's not that big of a deal and still looks fine when you use it. As far as stability and performance goes, AMD is perfectly fine.

The ""HDMI Forum"" exists to a large extent to make sure that DRM can extend all the way to the physical pixels on a screen, thus making it impossible to bypass digital restrictions by hooking into the raw video data sent over the display cable. Obviously HDMI support in an open source video driver would ruin that, because in order to make DRM over HDMI possible, the drivers on both ends need access to some kind of cryptographic key, and an open source driver would have to release that key under an open source license, which in turn would enable anyone to legally embed that key in their own code, thus rendering the DRM ineffective.",$AMD,reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- FMF is inferior to FSR3
- You need high base (pre-frame-generation) FPS (60fps for 1080p, ~70+ for 1440p and above) for the picture to be smoother and not look like kinda-somewhat-more fluid mess
- Somewhat connected to the one above, if you ""feel"" that it is worse than pre-frame-generation don't force yourself because it shows higher fps
- in-game or steam overlay or anything similar fps counters won't show generated frames, only AMD Adrenalin software
- It is and will be worse than high native framerate, even if native would be a bit lower than with generated frames",$AMD,reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A ""better"" amplifier would give less noise at that gain level, which you can describe as a lower ""noise figure""/""noise factor"". Any amplifier can be used at any ""gain level"", but obviously not all amplifiers are equally good.

And XeSS DP4a is in-between - more computational expense but also better quality. But you have to remember, each upscaler has its own ""quality curve"" - there is always the alternative of just turning down the resolution etc. Good AA alone or good speedups alone are table stakes here, you need both good AA and good speedups to stay relevant.",$AMD,reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
