0,"Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 6:08:44 PM GMT+9",ASML Monopoly,Noob here. Just curious how much of a monopoly ASML has on the semiconductor market. Is there anybody anywhere close to generating a lithography system similar to ASML's precision? Also just curious how they've managed to get to this position. Thanks in advance!!,$ASML,reddit
1,"Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 6:08:44 PM GMT+9",ASML Monopoly,"Toured the ASML factory a couple of years ago (looked at buying a tool), they said the DUV tools (the ones used for below 10 nm nodes), are in excess of $200M and takes up to 200 engineers 12 months to install. These tools are immensely complicated and took years to develop, and billions invested.",$ASML,reddit
2,"Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 6:08:44 PM GMT+9",ASML Monopoly,"Canon and Nikon are the other two big players in the market. There is a small overlap where all three offer tools for the same node. ASML has dominance for below 45 nm, probably below 90 nm. Canon strong in the 120-320 nm tools (immersion, i-line), and Nikon i-line market. Typical fabs will require all these tools to make a complete product... So less of a monopoly as the tools are complimentary. ASML for critical layers, Canon for mid layers, and Nikon for back end.",$ASML,reddit

4,"Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 6:08:44 PM GMT+9",ASML Monopoly,"All around these tools are just so complex and takes years of investment and engineering to make it a worthwhile product. Profits from tools they sell, they reinvest to make the tools better and develop new functionality. It is extremely difficult to get into this market from scratch... Lots of smaller companies that focus on unique markets. For instance UltraTech (now owned by Veeco) makes steppers for wafers with large bow/warpage. Some backend processes require this, overlay and CD less critical, so ASML/Canon/Nikon are too expensive for these processes.",$ASML,reddit

9,"Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 6:08:44 PM GMT+9",ASML Monopoly,"There are only a couple of BIG fish out there (such as: Intel, Samsung, TSMS, Global Foundries) and if you reach a node with a good overlay, consistent throughout and machine availability (there are many more specs, but those are the main ones), you get a big chunk of the market for that node. The competition (today, mostly Cannon and Nikon) would have to reach the same specs as ASML today to try to win some market back, but with the amount of head start ASML has, this is a lost cause for the existing nodes. I.e., they would better try to win the next node, than compete with existing and proven tech, especially since ASML had to spend years and billions in R&D to get there.",$ASML,reddit
10,"Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 6:08:44 PM GMT+9",ASML Monopoly,"The first program that achieved that "take-off" was DUV (Deep UV), with immersion lithography + twin scan (put a drop of water on top of the water to improve optics, and process two wafers simultaneously: one is scanned while the other gets imaged). This was completely new in the market and was key to making ASML #1. They almost doubled throughout, and immersion got them first to the next node. This was a huge jump.",$ASML,reddit

109,"Wednesday, April 17, 2024 at 3:22:21 PM GMT+9",Critical chip firm ASML posts profit beat but sales miss expectations with 22% drop,"ASML on Monday said first-quarter profit beat expectations while sales missed forecasts, with the company sticking to its full-year outlook.
Here’s how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates:
Net sales: 5.29 billion euros ($5.62 billion) versus 5.39 billion euros expected.
Net profit: 1.22 billion euros versus 1.07 billion euros expected.
Net sales fell 21.6% year-on-year while net income dropped 37.4%. ASML’s net sales fell in the middle point of the company’s guidance.
Net bookings for ASML’s machinery, a closely watched booking, totaled 3.6 billion euros in the first quarter, down 4% year-on-year but plunging nearly two thirds versus the December quarter.",$ASML,reddit
110,"Wednesday, April 17, 2024 at 3:22:21 PM GMT+9",Critical chip firm ASML posts profit beat but sales miss expectations with 22% drop,"ASML is one of the most important semiconductor firms in the world, producing tools known as extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are required to manufacture the most advanced chips globally.
Last year, weak demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and laptops hit chipmakers that produce semiconductors for those devices. That has in turn led to slightly weaker call for ASML’s gear. However, various semiconductor firms across the board, such as memory chipmaker Samsung, are seeing a rebound in demand. ASML has previously said it expects net sales for 2024 to be similar to 2023 and reiterated this projection on Monday. ASML reported net sales of 27.6 billion euros in 2023.
“Our outlook for the full year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first half, in line with the industry’s continued recovery from the downturn,” ASML CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement.
“We see 2024 as a transition year with continued investments in both capacity ramp and technology, to be ready for the turn in the cycle.” ASML’s equipment is purchased by the world’s biggest chip manufacturers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung and Intel. Part of ASML’s bullishness comes from the fact that Samsung, TSMC and Intel are ramping up production capacity in America, with the support of funding from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.
“I think by 2025 you will see all three of those coming together. New fab openings, strong secular trends and the industry in the midst of its upturn,” Roger Dassen, chief financial officer of ASML, said in a pre-recorded video interview.
ASML is yet to address any impact from export restrictions to China in the first quarter. Following U.S. pressure, the Dutch government last year introduced curbs in June on the export of advanced semiconductor equipment — including ASML’s machinery. However, the company said in a document released alongside its results, that sales of its systems to China accounted for 49% of the total in the first quarter, up from 39% in the fourth quarter of 2023. ASML previously said that export restrictions would impact 10% to 15% of China sales this year.",$ASML,reddit

They are a result of 35 years of research and development, to deliver just one of these tools to fab D1X in Oregon took 747 cargo planes 40 freight containers and 20 trucks and wirghs nearly 200 tons.

I join this multicast group on the wifi with the quest 3 and parse the incoming messages. The choppyness is not due to the wifi, we have another test stream which comes in fine. And the stutteryness is not due to the rendering because we render at 120hz without performance issues. This gives us confidence the issue is elsewhere in our robots software stack.",$ASML,reddit

In reality, months of round-the-clock processing is needed to produce a single chip using a variety of process types to build 3D structures on an atomic scale.(litho, etch, CVD, PVD, CMP, in-line metrology). Wafers will be transferred from machine to machine in a clean room environment literally hundreds of times, any failure of which can and will scrap the entire wafer. Each process has to be continuously calibrated and adjusted to ensure consistency while also not affecting later manufacturing steps. Litho is the gatekeeping tech for advanced chips but the secret sauce is in combining all of these overlapping process steps into a repeatable manufacturing process. The structure of the chip that enables smaller transistors is also proprietary and has a lot of complex physics involved for bigger brains than mine, look up GAA/FinFET as an example if you’re interested.

When you build a chip, not just every feature, but every layer, every mask, every cleaning step requires incredible control and precision. You may be able to draw the tiniest features with the tiniest photolithography machine, but that doesn't mean they'll develop into features that work if you don't design them correctly and also build before/during/after properly. There's levels on levels of design, process development, process control, manufacturing expertise. This is more than just a photolithography exercise.

Every machine has thousands of parameters that can be tuned for different performance, this is called process optimization. TSMC has lots of engineers who have a very good understanding of the intricacies of how to get the best performance out of each of these machines, and how to get the best performance in combination from one process step to the next, and to meet the unique customer specs. Making a chip designed by apple requires a significantly different process from making one for Nvidia, AMD, or Qualcomm. TSMC is good at making the ASML machines (and others) perform in the way they want to optimize for the specific features needed on different chips. There's also a ton of collaboration between companies like ASML and TSMC, so it's ot just TSMC doing it all alone, they consult with ASML engineers to get the best performance out of the machines for their specific needs (and ASML sharing this info with their other customers is legally forbidden).",$ASML,reddit

Immersion lithography for example, the bead of water on wafer can drag contaminants around, and redistribute them. This means there would be production processes that can be improved before lithography to reduce these defects. The redistribution pattern may indicate a particular type of problem, and that also needs solving. The redistribution distorts the location of the defects, making tracing them more difficult, so some spectrometry may be needed to trace the processes they originated from. Once again, the more times you go through this, the more routine it becomes, The more cases you see, the more likely you can trace the same problem the next time. Given enough routinization, and it may be worth while to collate the knowledge and alert on the same scenario earlier in production before you go through the lithography step, where defects often become unfixable "killer defects". More tools and more capacity justifies more staffing and more detailed analysis. Each time, they managed to trace the problem to the source, and each time they identify the next recurrence and adjust their production process to fix it, they get better. In this case, not just better at production, but having better final yields per wafer.",$ASML,reddit

1257,"Friday, May 10, 2024 at 11:58:31 AM GMT+9","If ASML makes the machines that create chips, what is the novel technology that differentiates fab companies capabilities from one another?","TSMC has its fabs in Taiwan's science parks, where many other fabs reside. This concentration of skill and knowledge means TSMC can gradually hire away the best and brightest, and then filter them through its many fabs to place the most dedicated and knowledgeable workers in the most advanced fabs. The concentration of fabs also means equipment manufacturers can stage spare parts and technical personal close by to support those science parks. An equipment problem in the middle of the night will get fixed in the middle of the night. While in the US, the scatter of fabs means reliance on shipping replacement parts and difficult cases means flying a person in to fix the problem. More fabs also mean more technical experts and support staff from equipment manufacturers, not just ASML, are constantly on site, and those experts are better and more seasoned. As mentioned above, there will be problems to solve before the litho step. So better/faster problem solving elsewhere, means less trouble for the engineering team running the AMSL tool.

Taiwan having staked its niche in semiconductors, can afford to have specialist education. This economic niche has become de facto industrial and education policy for students that want to chase this field. In the US, electrical/chemical engineers have a lot of other industry options, In fact for the TSMC Arizona fab, the complain coming from Taiwanese workers and management is that the US counterparts don't work as hard, but the US workers really do have other options and don't have to stay in the semi field. This hits Intel as well, also with an Arizona fab, but also hits every US based Intel site. TSMC can promote from within and hire young engineers to train from the bottom up. And now you have entrenched professionals that keeps that knowledge and experience that will only concentrate more for TSMC over time.

They can each be somewhere around 0.5%, and that will still be an insurmountable. Making chips is not 100%, there will be bad chips due to errors, so every percentage of yield matters. TSMC makes millions of wafers a year. The organization of wafer is typically 20~25 wafers in a lot, Many lots makes up a batch of orders, Many orders for the same chip constitute a device type, similar devices form a device family. The time and material for processing wafers is going to be fairly constant. Falling short may even mean starting new lots to fill production, thus costing more time and labor. If problem solving and learned improvement is giving single % differences, accumulated knowledge from more capacity and seeing more cases is giving single digit differences, and add in education, and locality. Single digits of yield improvement will then mean a few more good chips per wafer, and is millions of dollars of difference per contract. Even if you have two cadres of employees equally smart, the company that runs through more cycles will get better, faster. And the company that pulls up its production yield faster stays in the most profitable times of new product cycle longer. That is what translates fractions of % differences to become an incremental advantage multiplied by the endless, 24 hour production cycle.",$ASML,reddit

The wafer will be coated with a lacquer like material called a photoresist that will cure where the UV light shines on it. Then the uncured resist is washed away, then the wafer is etched to remove material from the areas not protected by the resist. The design of the reticle is typically left to each fab and will be different for not just every chip but every layer of every chip. ASML does not own the reticle designs.

The different parts of a lithography machine are so cutting-edge that doing it all could easily overwhelm any single company. “You have to decide where you add the most value and let others do the rest,” explains a former asml insider. Semiconductor economics likewise favours not doing everything yourself. The chip industry is prone to booms and busts, because demand moves up and down much more quickly than manufacturers can install capacity. Prices rise and fall as shortages turn to gluts. Makers of chipmaking gear are exposed to the same cycles. That makes keeping all the assets in-house risky; better to transfer some of that risk on to suppliers, who can in turn limit it by catering to customers who work to different business cycles.",$ASML,reddit

A wafer table in a lithography machine is similarly likely to miss the mark at first. The same is true of the rest of the device. It is only with the help of lots of data and machine-learning, a type of ai, that they can be fine-tuned—and made more accurate. This is rapidly turning asml into an ai platform.",$ASML,reddit

This all comes down to how you can make a transistor from differently doped, contaminated, silicon. This transistor is an amplifier and can be easily used to mimic a resistor or a capacitor or with a bit of trickery even a coil so basically these silicon pieces allow us to make any kind of circuit. We can control the contamination of very tiny regions around 40 nm or even less which means we can draw complex circuit onto a very small area.",$ASML,reddit
1873,"Saturday, February 10, 2024 at 8:07:18 PM GMT+9",ELI5: how does ASML chip making work ?,"So the kind of circuit is determined by the contaminated regions. We have two types of contamination, n and p type. Silicon on its own has 4 valence electrons like carbon but we don't need a lot of energy to brake these bonds. Still the silicon on its own is a poor conductor so we introduce some free-ish charge carriers by doping the lattice with another atom that has 5 electrons so 1 electron can be moved easily this is n type contamination or we introduce an atom with 3 valence electrons creating holes to which electrons can jump to and this functionality is like the hole is moving so we call it hole conduction, this is the p type.",$ASML,reddit
1874,"Saturday, February 10, 2024 at 8:07:18 PM GMT+9",ELI5: how does ASML chip making work ?,When it comes to ICs we specifically contaminate regions to n and p type. A cool fact to keep in mainf is that a fully n type silicon piece can be overcompensated with p type contamination since if we introduce 5 million extra electrons and 5 million extra holes we again have a lattice with 4 bonds around everywhere. This is rather helpful for manufacturing purposes. You make a sheet of silicon with lets say n type contamination all over it and then you place a mask on it which can block the beam for the p type atoms this is ion implantation you use a beam of ions to shoot them into the silicon and the mask can block them so you get the n and p type regions wherever you want.,$ASML,reddit

1876,"Saturday, February 10, 2024 at 8:07:18 PM GMT+9",ELI5: how does ASML chip making work ?,"Another big requirement for the ICs is the purity of the silicon lattice. Lattices often have defects like dislocations, a layer of atoms which doesn't streach the whole lattice and distorts it. Whats the issue with that? Well we have something like an 80 nm region (an atom is around 0.1 nm) and one half is n contamination and the other is p contaminated. Since diffusion is a thing the n contaminates and the p contaminates want to balance out and break down the region. This does happen but if you have lattice defects that speeds up the diffusion to unacceptable rates. In a regular lattice you would expect one or two dislocations per thes 40 nm region and having a dislocation slice through a transistor will break it down. So we cannot have that and the requirement is to not have more than 1 dislocation per cubic meter of lattice. So the matterial requirements are insane but right now this is only a technical challenge and we can definitely make these quality crystals.",$ASML,reddit
1877,"Saturday, February 10, 2024 at 8:07:18 PM GMT+9",ELI5: how does ASML chip making work ?,"And of course we can't talk ICs without addressing temperature. Usually cooling becomes more efficient when designing smaller things since a tiny thing has more surface area relative to its volume and so heat (which you can take away from the surface) can be carried away more efficiently. The bonds of silicon can easily be broken, as you increase temperature more bonds break, which increase conductivity which increase current which increases heating which increases conductivity, you see the problem. Useless you cool it the silicon will melt. The first transistors were yay big like the size of your fist and had to be cooled in liquid nitrogen. Right now fans are enough. But because once we dope silicon the fact that bonds are broken easily is not a welcome feature for this very reason. This is why research is being done on alternatives like diamond. Now the energy required to break the bonds of diamond is much greater so this heating cascade would be an issue. The biggest complication with diamond is that we don't have a good way of doping it.",$ASML,reddit

But did you know that if you remove the 3rd spatial dimension(2D space) entirely basically 0nm you get a mix called anyons. They are quasi-particles with a partial charge, partial charges aren’t possible with electrons. People claim there’s 2D materials like graphene(a single atom is 3D) and there’s this thing called a 2D electron gas also not truly 2D. But anyons only exist at 10 mK, because heat itself expands the 2D space into 3D with vibrations. So much so that they discovered phonons can traverse a vacuum when they made the Anyon experiments they failed the first time when they used boron nitride which conducts phonons quite well.",$ASML,reddit
