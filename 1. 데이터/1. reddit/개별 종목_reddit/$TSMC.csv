But in Taiwan, it will be fixed at 2 a.m.” And, he added, the wife of a Taiwanese engineer would “go back to sleep without saying another word.”",$TSMC,reddit

Vendors in Taiwan aren't deploying engineers in the wee hours without a PO or a night shift contract. And TSMC staff aren't fixing their cutting edge tools without those vendor staff.",$TSMC,reddit

3,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,"Yeah, it's not like 24/7 on call jobs are unusual in the US tech industry. If <pick big site of your choice> goes down at 2am, it gets addressed immediately, not the next morning.

5,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,"This isn't their first go at a fab in the US. Their last attempt, WaferTech, had similar issues and they never fully developed the site. How did they not learn from that and come into this with a better plan?",$TSMC,reddit
6,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,Because TSMC management probably doesn't actually care that much if the US fabs succeed. They're doing this because the Taiwanese and US governments are pressuring them to and (mainly) because the US government dropped billions of dollars worth of subsidies in their lap. Either it fails and they don't end up actually losing much money or it kinda works and they have some underperforming fabs they can use to churn out chips for the US military and civilian market at much higher prices.,$TSMC,reddit
7,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,Their attempts via WaferTech were made in the 1990s and early 2000s. I would venture to guess that almost nobody that worked through that endeavor is still at TSMC. That is why they didn’t learn from those mistakes.,$TSMC,reddit
8,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,"It’s already a costly endeavor to have a fab in the US, much more costly than it would be in Taiwan. After decades of success in Taiwan, TSMC knows what works for them. They would rather have the US adapt to their way of doing things than the other way around. And I’m not sure you can blame them either.",$TSMC,reddit
9,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,What’s unfortunate is the culture clash we are seeing. That should alleviate itself going forward as US employees pick up on the standards being taught by the Taiwanese employees.,$TSMC,reddit
10,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,"Sound like TSMC have fell for the FOMO mentality. They fear Intel and Samsung could outcompete them with American subsidies that they jump into this without proper planning. I find it hilarious some fans saying TSMC don't care about this being success or not. The US government doesn't cover all the cost of building these fabs, so TSMC would still lose alot of money if this didn't pan out.",$TSMC,reddit
11,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:37:40 AM GMT+9",TSMC’s debacle in the American desert,"Frankly, I think it’s more about politics and optics than FOMO. If you see the US making moves to diversify their supply chains, you would want to start preparing for the possibility that the US might at some point start to favour locally produced chips, or even mandate a certain % of local production. Better to put up a token fab and show that you’re making an effort, than to have it shoved down your throat later.",$TSMC,reddit

Just… I would trust them as far as I could throw one of the lithography machines. Get it in writing— DETAILED writing. Idk if this has changed (I was part of the first cohort), but all of the training material was in Chinese and I was tasked with translating it using google translate. Didn’t learn shit. We had pass downs every morning that I HAD to attend, but they were in Chinese. I got punished for pointing out to my boss that my attendance was worthless.

I haven't worked at a foundry, but I've worked in a different industry at a contract manufacturer and working at an OEM vs Contract Manufacturer (Fab vs Foundry in the semiconductor industry) is night and day! OEM is SO much better. There is so much more flexibility in timelines, cost expectations, capital expenses, etc. I would guess that it would be a good experience and that you'll learn a lot, but I would try and find an OEM fab to work at, Intel, Micron, TI, Samsung, one of those. Especially if work life balance is important to you, I'd try to work for an American company. Also, not sure if this is what you're interested in, but as a construction project engineer, my guess is that you will likely not get to deal with actual production very much. I imagine that all you'll be doing is coordinating teams for equipment installations and then hand the equipment off to an equipment and process engineer.

The places with issues are new developments on the outskirts where they don’t have any water rights and no existing water infrastructure is in place. They are totally dependent on groundwater.

There are certainly a lot of rumors with how it’s been going, which I can’t substantiate, so take it for what it’s worth. I’ve heard that the trades are/were very pissed because of the lack of job site safety. Unions walked off the job a few times for the same reasons and for the use of non-union labor in some jobs. They’ve been having problems finding workers because the expectation is 50-60 hours per week and the pay is only average to begin with. Keep in mind that Intel has a huge facility in Chandler that they’re competing with, about 45 mins south of where this one is. Training consists of going to Taiwan for a few months and I believe a commitment to working for them for a year after that. There are chartered flights to/from Taiwan just for TSMC.",$TSMC,reddit

I actually don’t know what making (the US equivalent of $150k/yr ) doing “trade” work looks likes.

That's not true in the US. I used to work at Intel in Oregon and I took a three quarters pay cut to go back to Taiwan to work for family.

Meanwhile, since TSMC had to delay production at its Fab 21 to 2025, Tesla either decided to port its FSD 4 design to N3P and make it in Taiwan or slow production of FSD 4 hardware in the U.S. by six or more months.

Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

However, there was not a single indication of China wanting to take Taiwan for its chip factory (the “reunification” rhetoric has always been there and is as old as your great-grandparents) and to weaponize TSMC subsequently (but now, I am sure they are having ideas, thanks to US weaponizing it in the first place).",$TSMC,reddit

Asking a highly skilled senior electrician to leave their family and relocate to another country for a year, only to come back and make 60-70% of what they could get working for Intel or Boeing or Honeywell or Lucid, or any of the myriad advanced manufacturers with operations in AZ, is never going to work.",$TSMC,reddit

Thus, the company (TSMC) needs to milk every little bit of production out of it as quickly as possible before the plant needs another multiple billion dollar overhaul to make it slightly LESS out of date. This along with the fact that there's razor thin margins on semi-conductors in the first place, is what's leading the thought that the US being a place where they 1.) don't have experience on fabs and thus lack manpower and training and 2.) is a place where historically things are done at a snails pace as compared to how Asia operates especially with those pesky “regulations”, would be a failure from the beginning.",$TSMC,reddit

3597,"Wednesday, August 9, 2023 at 10:33:06 AM GMT+9",US TSMC plant faces calls to ban Taiwanese workers,"Building a fab is very sensitive to time and money. A fab, when built, is but an empty building. The chip manufacturers don't make their own tools, those have to be bought. Many tools need floor reinforcements and become semi-embedded into room when installation is complete. So, this means building completion time has to match concurrency with tool delivery time, AND the labor availability time of the equipment manufacturer to come install. All of these are specialized labor coming directly from equipment makers, construction delay will cause much bigger problems down the line.",$TSMC,reddit

Historical high temperature and not finding enough workers willing to work in such conditions? contractor's fault. Electrical/water/clean room systems not up standards quick enough? contractor's fault. If the union labor is mixed in there then it is the union labor fault too. To win and keep the job the work must be up to snuff. The next big focus is on driving down near zero interference with semi manufacturing. Focusing on PPM contaminants in water, air, seismic isolation, full equipment traceability all to squeeze the next percent out of yield. If the construction is being deliberately slacked on it cannot reach those standards. Intel is also building a fab across town, if Arizona can't come up with the results then out of state labor and specialized company labor should takes those jobs, if that is still not enough then TW labor is the next reasonable step. To be good at semi construction, you have to be already good at semi construction.

4272,"Tuesday, November 28, 2023 at 7:40:24 AM GMT+9",TSMC ADR vs TSMC actual stock,"This phenomenon revolves around the concept of fungibility. In most cases, Depositary Receipts (DRs), including American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) like TSM US, are fungible. This means they can be exchanged between markets. Typically, investors can buy shares in one market (TSM US) and convert them to another market (2330 TT), with a fee charged by the agent bank (TSM US is sponsored by Citi Bank). This fungibility facilitates arbitrage. Arbitrageurs (usually institutional investors) long the stock in the market where it's undervalued and short it in the market where it's overvalued. They then convert the stock from one form to the other (from ADR to home country stock or vice versa) to collapse the positions. This activity tends to equalize the prices in both markets because the buying pressure in the undervalued market and the selling pressure in the overvalued market help align the prices.",$TSMC,reddit

These modern factories cost ~$10B and 3-5 years just to build the building and facilities, before you install tools. However, when demand comes in, you want a building ready to install tools in. Why? Because wafers from a leading edge node are sold for $20k - $30k (I know that's the right range but I don't work for TSMC or interact with them so please do your own math.) These are ~5k wafers per week factories (again just based on following the news, not what they'll end up being). Well, $20k x 5k = $100M in revenue per week.

Gelsinger added that following on from Meteor Lake (expected to be launched later this month), Intel will be ramping its Intel 3 process (5 nm) “soon”.

Well thats basically what textures are, similar to pixels on a screen. Each 'box' is a texture pixel, or a texel, a single square of color. The more boxes on your graph paper, the more squares your texture has, the better and cleaner it looks, this is called the textures resolution, and is typically stated by the number of squares of its length, multiplied by the number of squares of its height, sm64 had things like 32x32, but lets go bigger like 256x256. Just like with plotting points in 3d space, using floating point math you can 'wrap' that texture around a 3d model, like a sticker, or map the texture. Every single 'box' or texel of your texture, needs a floating point operation used with the information of the 3d model its being applied to. So that 256x256 texture needs 65,536 operations to be wrapped on a model (this is an over simplification, but it gets the general point across). When you move that model, do all the math again. This has to be done many times a second like 30 times, or 60 times (or for some games 20 lol) to give the illusion of movement. So 65,536x30 = 1,966,080.

(Drawing a straight line out from a polygons face so it is perfectly perpendicular, like a flag pole, is called a 'normal', if you've ever heard the phrase 'normal mapping' there you go) and determine how bright or dark light from that angle would be reflecting towards the game camera, and then blend that light/dark value, the color of the light, and the texel from the texture together, or shade it. Color values, to computers are numbers, there is a value for how much red, green, and blue stored as numbers, as well as a number for tone, or light and dark.... needing.... you guessed it, flops to calculate.

Those days are long gone and these older companies are going to fail in these efforts. The money is rolling in on contracts, but they’ll inevitably go hugely over budget and either the bottom will drop out or govt will step in to ensure they turn into job programs ultimately as with multiple aerospace companies.

But it's also not sustainable to massively drop prices and miscalibrate consumer expectations for future generations/etc. Just as they found out with 1080 Ti vs 20-series, and just as AMD is finding out with the RX 7600 - cutting too far leads to future problems down the road. Smooth generational iteration is better than revenue today from hyperdealz followed by what feels like a large bump (or even just perceived stagnation) with the next generation. You are only screwing next year's revenue by over-cutting this year, because anyone sitting on a 4070 or a 6800XT doesn't really need an upgrade again for a while, with the way moore's law is slowing they might not buy another card for another 5 years, probably at least 3 years.",$TSMC,reddit
5498,"Friday, May 26, 2023 at 5:31:38 PM GMT+9",Nvidia rush orders lifting TSMC 5nm fab utilization,"Paradoxically, people being obstinate about just flatly refusing to buy anything no matter how good the deal also creates an incentive to just chase margin on the sales they can actually make. If they sell 100 cards at $600 and 110 cards at $500, it's certainly not worth chasing the guy who is only going to upgrade if he gets a 4070 for $329 even if they would sell 200 cards. Even $500 is probably a much lower margin than NVIDIA would like, if $500 doesn't produce a large increase in sales it's certainly not worth going deeper this early in the product cycle. Remember, they have to fund the development of the next generations out of that too, it's not just BOM cost. Even $400 would be apocalyptic let alone the $329 fantasies/etc. Not every customer can be satisfied even if there is some price at which they would be willing to buy.",$TSMC,reddit

It's better to just move their wafers to enterprise for a couple years and wait it out. This was inevitable, it happens after every mining cycle, it's one of the reasons that EVGA decided to leave on a high note after the massive 10x profit of the mining years. Demand was obviously going to suck for a while after mining finally slumped off.",$TSMC,reddit

That was always an option. Just not one that made financial sense for NVIDIA. Losing money on every sale but making it up in volume is a meme not a real business strategy.

People think Ampere and Turing were too expensive and actually they were cheaper than they should have been (if NVIDIA had shrunk to TSMC N7 like AMD did, then prices would have been higher). That's a problem of mis-calibrated consumer expectations. Now that Ada is snapping back to the real price curve, it feels way way too expensive rather than just another generational price increase.",$TSMC,reddit
5502,"Friday, May 26, 2023 at 5:31:38 PM GMT+9",Nvidia rush orders lifting TSMC 5nm fab utilization,"4070 reaching $600 is about right on the price curve compared to the previous 2 leading node products - GTX 670 at $399 and GTX 1070 at $429 FE MSRP. $500 for 3070 was fair (3060 Ti for $400 was supposed to be the deal and was incredibly good to the extent partners didn’t want to follow msrp) and 4070 being $600 is about fair, perhaps also slightly cheap, you can really argue ""fair"" might be closer to $649 for 4070 given the node cost. Hitting de-facto $500 like the microcenter deal is incredibly good, out-of-band value and people still turned their nose up. So $600 it is: if you're not gonna sell that many, at least you make some margin on the ones you do sell.",$TSMC,reddit
5503,"Friday, May 26, 2023 at 5:31:38 PM GMT+9",Nvidia rush orders lifting TSMC 5nm fab utilization,"And again, AMD is facing the same thing. They over-cut on 6600/6700 family, now 7600 looks like shit in comparison. It's not that bad a product, they just over-cut on 6000 series and now an ""only okay"" product looks like shit. People were expecting it to blow away an already-great price on 6000 series and of course it didn't, now HUB kicking up a fuss on 8GB has forced them to lower that model deeply to get underneath NVIDIA and the 4060 8GB (see also: the awesome “8gb is enough!!!” slides in the 7600 launch deck). Mis-calibrated expectations lead to disastrous launches, if they'd kept prices $50-75 higher instead of over-cutting then 7600 could have swept in like a hero at $300 or $279. “8GB is DOA above $399"" or ""DOA above $349"" is a completely different story from ""DOA above $299"", and AMD themselves manifested that particular number with the deep cuts on 6700 family. And now 7600 is DOA at $269 and probably needs to fall to $229 or $199 (perhaps a cutdown) if nvidia is willing to slot in at $299. So those price cuts on 6700 cost them at least $50, probably closer to $75 a card in margin on 7600 by mis-calibrating expectations, on a card they hoped would be $300. That’s fucking dire, that's like half the margin they expected and it's literally launch day. They can probably weekend-at-bernies it along with 16gb for $299 but that is also something they could have sold for $350+ if managed more appropriately.",$TSMC,reddit

Products that don’t make margin, don’t get generational upgrades. If you want a $100 card you buy a 1030, if you want a $50 card it’s a GT210/Radeon 5450. there is no current part that gets to $50 MSRP, no matter how crippled and shitty, because it’s not something you can make a margin on. If $200 or $250 isn’t sustainable as a gaming price point… there won’t be another. Easy call, happened before and it’ll happen again. It’s already the smallest RDNA3 die, on a weird shitty 6nm version of RDNA3 instead of the mainline 5nm family… it’s teetering on the edge already, and if they’re making $50 less margin than expected on the $300 card that’s probably not boding well for future $200-300 releases.",$TSMC,reddit

The deep sale today is great, but then you need to cut deeper next year, and over time you train your customers that’s normal (because it is) and if you try to go back to normal they stop buying because they know (or think) you’ll yield eventually. Video games have gone through the same thing, steam sales from the 2010s were too deep and companies have backed away from it because training consumers that if they wait a year or two they get the AAA game at $7.49 isn’t good for overall revenue.

It also states that ""The US semiconductor industry maintains more of its manufacturing base in the US than in any other country"". It also states ""U.S. semiconductor firms have maintained their competitive edge in microprocessors and other leading-edge devices, as well as having continued to lead in a range of other product areas. In addition, U.S. semiconductor firms maintain a leading position in R&D, design, and process technology"". So why is so much focus put on TSMC? Is it because it's responsible for disproportionately producing high end chips? How important are high end chips to the US defence establishment? I read somewhere that the avionics of even a modern fifth generation jet like the F-35 are more akin to like, a PS2, and most other current widely used technologies in the US military aren't really that new*.* So is the whole TSMC issue just blown up a lot for political reasoning?

We had to switch to a new technology for the transistors (FINFET I believe which are laid vertically and look like a shark fin). The whole article is actually deciding which is the better approach. Both Intel and TSMC use UV light to mark the transistors on the silicon however Intel has brought the new more advanced machine. It uses a wider aperture for the UV light allowing smaller features on a single pattern. TSMC is going to use a technique called double patterning which involves exposing to the UV light twice but takes more time and can have higher failure rates. You can even do triple patterning with more of the issues. Intel will be able to do these new sizes faster and could later do double and triple patterning giving them possibility of even smaller sizes. Finally the manufacturer of these machines is working on a machine with an even wider aperture which will allow considerably smaller features and ultimately double and triple patterning will be possible on those getting us quite far in the Moores law pathway.

These CoWoS machines are very expensive, complex, and have long lead times so it's going to take a while to increase capacity to meet demand, and other existing machines won't cut it either because they're not advanced enough and/or have too low of a yield (a defect in the CoWoS step can't be salvaged afterwards and effectively kills the otherwise working GPU die(s) and HBM stacks).",$TSMC,reddit

And making more AD102 and below dies has a similar problem, where they'll have an overstock of RTX 4000 cards that aren't selling (poor consumer value), so when Nvidia comes out with the RTX 5000 series of cards, they'll still have warehouses of RTX 4000 cards they want to sell, which will likely affect RTX 5000 pricing and availability since they want the old stock out. Nvidia's not making more dies than are necessary because that's dumb business, it's burning profit away by having an oversupply of RTX 4000 cards that they'll sit on and eventually discount to get to sell.

As you build higher and higher, you need more elevators which take up more ground space and they need to move faster and faster as well as be larger and larger the higher you go.

The example I would give you if Apple does in fact start producing chips for accelerated computing in AI, they are more than likely to occupy the majority of the flagship capacity which would be a problem for NVDA. It's something Apple has done with smartphone chips. It's what NVDA is doing to its competitors by occupying a majority of the allocation for advanced node processes.

6713,"Tuesday, November 28, 2023 at 8:28:17 PM GMT+9","Intel to place US$14 billion orders with TSMC, says report","Interesting shift, considering Intel's historical emphasis on in-house fabrication. This move might actually bode well for AMD in a few ways, though.
Firstly, Intel's reliance on TSMC for fabrication suggests a pivot from their traditional strategy of leading with their fabrication capabilities. This levels the playing field somewhat, as both Intel and AMD will be relying on a third-party fabricator, focusing competition more on architecture than on proprietary manufacturing processes.
Additionally, Intel investing heavily in TSMC doesn't just mean a shared playing field; it also implies a diversion of resources away from their own fab advancements. This could slow down Intel's progress in catching up or overtaking AMD in terms of fabrication technology.
However, it's worth noting AMD's recent financials too. Their Q3 results showed 206% YoY rise in revenue, with a particularly strong showing from their Data Center division. This speaks volumes about their current market position and growth trajectory.
While Intel's move might bring them some short-term gains in terms of performance per watt, it could potentially come at a higher cost, possibly making AMD's offerings more attractive in terms of value for money.
In essence, it's more about strategic positioning and less about outright dominance in any single area",$TSMC,reddit

Is it because of cost and availability of nVIDIA products? The time and cost of designing your own chip, taping it out and testing it, designing the hardware, interconnect and data center infrastructure around it, and then writing the drivers and kernels to support your chip around it is very high and for Tesla, it's for internal use only and not-for-sale to customers. Is all of that worth it to squeeze more flops here and there? Even AMD is having a hard time getting their foot in the door of this business when some of their MI300X specs look better than H100. Meanwhile, all of that is nVIDIA's core business and they've jump-started their data center business since Jensen delivered their first DGX-1 to Elon in 2016 for OpenAI. So... why? 🤔",$TSMC,reddit

Like since Transistor density increase by 30% I think GB203 with 96SMs full die is just under AD103 meaning if 350mm2 & GB202 being a doubling of spec leading to 700mm2 isn't that far off AD102 size and N3E as mentioned won't be able to shrink that much.,$TSMC,reddit

The issue is Apple tuned it to have an even higher power limit than those two chips. According to Geekerwan's testing, A17 Pro was eating up 14 watts during the Geekbench run, which is absolutely crazy on a smartphone (probably due to the P-cores being clocked at 3.78 GHz). Apple could easily fix the overall overheating issue with smarter/less aggressive scheduling in iOS.
