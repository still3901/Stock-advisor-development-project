Not saying don’t take the police route but your best bet is to take help from the card issuing bank and maybe escalate with central bank for support. But again, since this is not a credit card, be aware that banks can also raise their hands saying the transaction liability on a debit card lies on the customer. To make things worse in your case, your card was added to Apple Pay for which authentication was done using an OTP that comes to your registered mobile number or email with the bank. So if those are compromised, banks really can’t protect your transactions. Having said all that, pls don’t give up and keep trying and all the best to you.",$TXN,reddit
