Fake job scams come in many different varieties, though most share common characteristics that you can use to spot the scam before becoming a victim. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Google Hangouts or a similar online service. Their English will be awkward, and they may be re-using a script, so Googling unique sounding parts of the email may yield useful results. They will offer high wages for the work being done, and they will ""hire"" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country. If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a fake check scam. If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a parcel mule scam. If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an advance-fee scam. If the job involves posting advertisements on Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam people. If the job invovles Bitcoin ATMs, it's a scam.

I was recently contacted by a Henry Durham with an interview questionnaire, then job offer similar to what others have posted. What struck me as odd was the usage of LLC when i searched the company there was no mention of subsidiaries, affiliations etc showing an LLC, second i tried searching for the scammer on linkedin and they also had no online presence, then i contacted Micron and their HR dept confirmed that they neither sent the offer nor do they have an employee by the name. Next steps was to file a complaint with the FTC. I am posting this in hopes of helping others who might be approached by this Henry Durham (email address: henry@jobs-micron.com).",$MU,reddit,,,

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your ""earnings"" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.",$MU,reddit,,,

Micron Joinder has adjusted schedule to where Judge Gilstrap will rule on 912 before PTAB! Told you 6 months ago that the 912 would be settled in Texas!,"Very interesting...
The swift reaction Netlist-Sheasby has had in response to the PTAB decision makes it clear that Netlist's legal team expected this decision and were prepared.
Samsung is up against the wall on at least 63 claims of the 912 patent. Also Micron will first receive the judgment from the Texas jury trial on the 912 patent and other patents before the PTAB has time to rule on those patents.
Great move by Sheasby and the rest of the lawyers on the legal team defending the interests of Netlist and its shareholders.",$MU,reddit,,,
