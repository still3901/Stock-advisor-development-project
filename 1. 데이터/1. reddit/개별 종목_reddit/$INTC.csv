On the other hand, it seems like Intel is undervalued and poised as a possible underdog to step up and take some market share.

I honestly wasn't expecting anything from it until 2025. There's a lot of work that goes into updating top end chip fabrication, years and billions. Semi's are sort of cyclical from what I have seen, invest in the next tech, then run it as long as you can to profit. Intel ran it too long this time, trying to eek it out with dual patterning to skip EUV and paid the price when cutting corners didn't work out. TSMC took the lead there.

Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.",$INTC,reddit

FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).",$INTC,reddit

2. INTC is a huge benefactor of the CHIPS ACT.
3. INTC also makes GPU’s competitive with NVDA. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html
I don’t think NVDA will buy INTC as its too expensive and
they won’t merge because shareholders wont allow it but they will compliment
and benefit from each other’s success in the new world of AI.

And yeah those comments from Nvidia were certainly encouraging for Intel but that doesn't mean the pickaxes will be fabbed in the US rather than Taiwan and South Korea - though Intel getting up to the standard that they can even be used by NVDA as a bargaining chip to haggle for lower prices with TSMC is a good sign for them.,$INTC,reddit

1453,"Wednesday, May 31, 2023 at 6:17:54 AM GMT+9",Is INTC dead weight?,"Hi all, I'm looking for some input on what to do regarding INTC shares currently in my portfolio. I'm still pretty new to investing (August will be 1 year in the market) and I still don't know much regarding a lot of the details that go into a company's valuation. When I first started investing, I picked up INTC shares for multiple reasons, a number of which are probably not the brightest. This was right around the time of the CHIPs Act which gave me some confidence in Intel as a longer-term holding, and as a student without a full-time job, the idea that my investment would have reasonably frequent dividend payouts to feed back into my portfolio seemed enticing. However, as I'm sure most people here know, Intel was anything but a good investment. I'm down a little over 14%, translating to roughly $124 in value lost. While I've tried to balance things out and diversify (and make more informed decisions), Intel continues to drag my portfolio down. I've been contemplating just cutting losses and pulling out entirely so my deficit doesn't continue to grow, but I wanted to see if anyone had any input before I did so. Does anyone see Intel making any sort of real comeback in 5-10 years' time, or is the consensus that Intel's poor business choices and ineffective leadership have stunted it to the point that it is going to be eternally stuck behind its competition? To simplify, does anyone think it's worth holding onto my position, or should I bail before the ship takes on any more water? Thanks in advance!",$INTC,reddit

But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price.
