Over on the AMD_Stock reddit, they hope that the big guys will develop some competition for NVDA (they're generally NVDA haters, while NVDA stock buyers barely think about AMD), but this ain't gonna happen. Even if the big tech companies develop their own AI chip, it will take years to develop and in the meantime, they will still need to buy NVDA chips, just like TSLA is developing their own chip while buying tons of NVDA chips. You can be sure that MSFT, META, and GOOGL have already tested some MI300X against NVDA solutions and likely found them inferior, because if that were not the case, then it would be in their best interest to announce they're buying tons of AMD chips in order to drive down the price of NVDA chips. However, that's not happening.",$NVDA,reddit
80,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 4:12:25 AM GMT+9",NVDA Earnings Upside Coming but first an AMD Earnings Dip,"None of the big players are announcing big purchases of AMD MI300X. GOOGL outright said they won't offer any AMD server solutions in the AI space. META, MSFT, AMZN all have mentioned AMD as an ""alternative"" at best, with no estimates shared on quantities they will order (probably just enough for testing). Meanwhile, MSFT saying they're gonna buy like 80,000 or 120,000 NVDA chips and META coming out with figures north of 300,000 and don't forget China ""can't"" buy them even though they can totally buy them through other countries. If China is ""not"" buying [but they are], then that means the US Gov't is also buying, and Defense contractors are also buying. AMD for their part, needs the big players to use their chips so they can tout big partners to their shareholders, so AMD is likely selling their MI300X to them at a discount. Hard to tell though... notice how no one seems to know how much or how many MI300X chips are getting sold, just like no one is posting up any benchmarks of the MI300X chips (makes me think these companies are under NDA or something).",$NVDA,reddit

But Lisa Su isn't that kind of CEO. She's a pragmatist, looking for steady incremental growth in established markets. That kind of strategy was great to pull AMD out of debt and it beat a company like Intel who's been dead in the water for the last 6 years, but it won't even leave a dent in a company like NVDA that can both innovate and strategize at the highest levels. NVDA has been laying the groundwork for AI for the last 6 years a completely new market opportunity, while AMD has been focusing on gaining Intel's enterprise server share. AMD = we'll battle for market share in long established product segment. NVDA = we'll invent an entirely new product segment with exponential growth opportunity and we'll dominate it. Something to keep in mind... NVDA announced last year they would explore Photonics with TSMC, and for the past 2 years they've been working on CUDA for developing Quantum computers. By the time AI has cooled down, NVDA will be leading the next big computing revolution while AMD is still trying to battle for 7-10% AI share.",$NVDA,reddit

It's likely that AMD will gap down on earnings due to confirmation of demand in-line with expectations for their MI300X competitor chip. Wallstreet wants AMD to come out and say they're gonna sell 6bn of their MI300X chips this year, up from 3.5bn est from their last earnings report in Jan. I checked the whisper number on AMD and it's not looking good, even the published estimate has been reduced over the last month to only .59 - .60 which is a paltry 1.2% higher YoY.

83,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 4:12:25 AM GMT+9",NVDA Earnings Upside Coming but first an AMD Earnings Dip,"If you can't tell, I'm very bullish on NVDA. The only things holding it back are institutional limits on how much they can buy for the year and for each half of the year at that. This is why NVDA 'maxed out' around $500 last year, and then rocketed to 750 before they even reported Q4 '23 numbers. If institutions had been allowed to allocate more to NVDA last year, then it would've run up to that number in 2023. When I say ""allowed"" I'm just referring to the fact that institutions usually have rules around how much of their portfolio can be in one stock. NVDA rises so fast, that it can easily go from 5% of a portfolio to 8% and then that company will be forced to sell until it's back to 5% of the portfolio value. After this Earnings season, i think institutions will look at the numbers, look at the forecasts, and decide to go overweight NVDA and trim back all their other AI plays... this will pave the way to 1100-1200 if it happens and next year NVDA 1600-2000+ is on the table. If that sounds ridiculous, just consider that AMD's PE is 288 today, while NVDA's PE is 68.

If history repeats then NVDA likely finds a top in the second half of next year and then starts a longer correction, this would be in-line with prior NVDA hyperbolic run-ups. The degree of those run-ups in the past were correlated to far less relative EPS growth than what NVDA is showing now though. In these scenarios people look back on the prior year and realize they should've bought when they thought it was ""overpriced"" because it looks like a steal in hindsight.",$NVDA,reddit
89,"Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 4:12:25 AM GMT+9",NVDA Earnings Upside Coming but first an AMD Earnings Dip,"As far as the Nokia analogy goes, I'd liken NVDA more to AAPL than Nokia. AAPL created an ecosystem with tight software / hardware integration. Out of all the semi's, I think NVDA is the only one with that kind of synergy going on. AMD tends to just make everything Open Source, which is morally admirable, but lazy in the innovation department. They are ""hoping"" that someone can figure out a way to maximize a somewhat generic architecture. This is in contrast to NVDA making more specialized hardware to work exceedingly well with their dominant software. The analogy in mind is a world where AAPL releases the iphone, and then 6 years later Nokia comes in with their first smart phone relying an open source OS (Nokia = AMD).",$NVDA,reddit

NVDA can make lots of chips work at the same time with 100-something TB/s of bandwidth per rack? That's insane. Meanwhile, AMD has to use PCIe and Ethernet to scaleout their clusters. This is why AMD only does small batches for their performance numbers, they need it to be something that can be processed by one cluster (just a guess on my part). If they released benchmarks of batches requiring more than one-cluster then they'd hit bandwidth 800G ethernet limitations (again just my guess). I think that's 800 Giga-BIT / sec vs 100-something Tera-BYTE / sec with NVDA. Ultra Ethernet just recently formed a group to plan the spec... so if history is anything to go by, that UE will take another 2 years to get hammered out and another year to deploy.",$NVDA,reddit

Its about building whole systems which is not as easy as some people might think... getting the chips + a good SW to effeciently use that chip is already a huge task and this is where AMD is currently stuck but this is just a small part of the puzzle... getting everything in place CPU + GPU + moving data around + smooth integration + good ecosystem so developers dont waste time trying to get ""basic"" stuff up and running is a monumental task and takes not only lots of resources but also a lot of time that you cant just buy.",$NVDA,reddit

There are a lot of assumptions for it to be transformative at this point I believe. Could you get a better ROI with another stock or etf over time is anyone’s guess. I think with AI it depends on where it goes beyond the initial infrastructure builds that are likely to be cyclical (my understanding anyway). A friend said - who knows what company at this point will be most successful if the AI boom is as transformative as some believe. And for the record I’m a believer. I’ve gone with QQQ as I can’t answer my own question of who will really end up dominating. And QQQ is a bit  of a hedge should tech not be as strong as one would think. It has its risks too. Basically to be able to make close to 20% average returns over 10 years - I’d rather use time to build than make a potential all in play at this level.

So my play would be to wait until after earnings, get most of the IV crush out of the way, and then sell a bull put spread at the first open after earnings. Vol should still be higher than it will be at end of that session, and you have a good risk-reward given that the dip buyers should appear on the first day, and then again in the following days.

Imo you shouldn't own a stock if you don't understand the fundamentals of the company. So in an effort to educate worried shareholders on this subreddit, I would like to share my thoughts on NVDA's fundamentals, addressing the business and the common concerns I see.",$NVDA,reddit
1143,"Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 6:33:47 PM GMT+9",Addressing NVDA concerns,"First off, why would someone want to own shares in NVDA stock? Surface level, if you asked the average person today, they would say the reason is that Nvidia is benefiting from A.I. chip sales. While this is true, this is not the entire reason to find Nvidia compelling. A.I. is the fuel source for the larger secular trend of accelerated computing.",$NVDA,reddit
1144,"Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 6:33:47 PM GMT+9",Addressing NVDA concerns,"And what is accelerated computing? To preface, Moore's law has slowed down significantly due to the limit on how small transistors can get before quantum tunneling occurs. The way around this problem in order to get more compute is accelerated computing, a heterogeneous computing paradigm that makes use of specialized computer components such as GPUs, DPUs, ASICs, and software along with the CPU to offload tasks from the CPU to gain more compute and efficiency as opposed to CPU-only based general purpose computing.",$NVDA,reddit
1145,"Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 6:33:47 PM GMT+9",Addressing NVDA concerns,And so this paradigm shift from general purpose computing to accelerated computing is the key to Nvidia's future growth for years to come. The majority of data centers today still use general purpose computing and will switch to accelerated computing if those companies want to stay competitive.,$NVDA,reddit
1146,"Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 6:33:47 PM GMT+9",Addressing NVDA concerns,"The next question you may ask is what makes Nvidia special in accelerated computing? Can't other companies produce products just like Nvidia to fulfill modern data center needs? What's special about Nvidia is the platform they have built for nearly two decades. The CUDA API is a software moat that often gets downplayed for its importance, but it is significant because it has created a mature platform for developers. Similar to Apple's ecosystem or Meta's family of apps, Nvidia's full stack solutions platform makes it difficult for customers to switch to other vendors due to high switching costs and the strong network effect.",$NVDA,reddit
1147,"Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 6:33:47 PM GMT+9",Addressing NVDA concerns,"One of the main bear cases I see for Nvidia's business model is that big tech will develop their own custom ASICs to replace Nvidia GPUs. The problem with this argument is that it ignores the difficulty of creating a replacement for Nvidia GPUs. While big tech can make custom ASICs for specific tasks in their data centers, custom ASICs cannot replace Nvidia GPUs for all the tasks they do. Big tech will still need Nvidia GPUs for versatile accelerated computing tasks. And the reason they choose Nvidia over AMD is because of the mature CUDA developer platform.",$NVDA,reddit
1148,"Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 6:33:47 PM GMT+9",Addressing NVDA concerns,"The other bear case I often see is the valuation for NVDA. An objective way to estimate NVDA's valuation is to consider the PEG ratio (Price to Earnings to Growth). NVDA right now is approximately $800 per share. Fiscal year 2024 (calendar year 2023) earnings per share was about $12. Fiscal year 2025 (calendar year 2024) earnings per share is estimated to be about $24. Therefore, P/E trailing twelve months is 67, and forward P/E is 33. I'll leave it to you to decide if you think it is expensive or cheap based on these numbers.",$NVDA,reddit

The stock dipped in AHs but bounce right back and closed in the green the next day. There is zero chance NVDA will post disappointing numbers. The question is how much is the beat and guidance. Analysts want to know if the demand is going to tapering out soon. Is this like ZOOM or Peloton? Or do they have another year of insane demand. If there are signs of tapering demand, the stock will crater to low 600s. If, as I expect, they will blow out the numbers (22-23B rev) and guide way higher for next ER (25B rev), then the stock might respond lukewarm or it might go parabolic.

The street is expecting them to have 70B+ of AI sales this year which would require them to hit their 20B guide for this quarter and do a couple billion better than that on average for the next 3.

1730,"Saturday, April 20, 2024 at 11:59:13 PM GMT+9",NVDA Thoughts,Wanted to express some thoughts on NVDA drop on Friday. I feel it was a coordinated drop by Banks on no internal news using the cover of ASML weakness and geopolitical uncertainty to wipe out calls. Greedy Banks were caught offsides as they should have been because they have monkeys for traders. They didn't hedge the Heavy Call options purchases and that is why post ER the stock couldn't rise past $1k even though NVDA is growing at 300% YoY and is #3. Dark Pools are a thing and people seem to have forgotten that fact post GME / AMD situation.,$NVDA,reddit
1731,"Saturday, April 20, 2024 at 11:59:13 PM GMT+9",NVDA Thoughts,The fact that NVDA's PR post-GTC Event sucked monkey balls is another factor. It's like the investor relations department went on vacation and decided to let the media attempt to do their work for them. They found out quick that there is no love or loyalty on Wall Street. It's was easier for the media to sell the Too Far/ Too fast story especially when large managers missed the boat. They needed a cover story and fabricated one.,$NVDA,reddit

1733,"Saturday, April 20, 2024 at 11:59:13 PM GMT+9",NVDA Thoughts,All that being said the Banks (Call writers) have mitigated their wrong-side trade exposure and will probably let NVDA run again. Nothing is certain but it seems that way to me.,$NVDA,reddit
1734,"Saturday, April 20, 2024 at 11:59:13 PM GMT+9",NVDA Thoughts,I do have some other theories regarding powers that be not wanting to see Apple drop to the #3 spot even though they are the chief monkey ball suckers on the street right now and predicted to be for at least another couple of years. People don't like change especially when their portfolios are unprepared for it. Managers have been playing up Apple for so long as a cornerstone for all portfolios they are afraid of looking regarded if they try to right the narrative now. Usually analysts are betas that only follow what they feel is safe. They will wait for the change to already happen before calling it like it's a new idea all of a sudden.,$NVDA,reddit

1743,"Saturday, April 20, 2024 at 11:59:13 PM GMT+9",NVDA Thoughts,"The benefit is to exit their written Calls without getting decimated by unanticipated interest in NVDA. Rarely does a company gain popularity so quickly on the street as NVDA has. The Banks were taking it up the ANOOS because they are obligated to take the other side of the trade at market price. The options were catching such a bid that the rest of the market was falling yet NVDA was making daily gains. The Banks are in self preservation mode. Everything went to Dark Pools after GTC. I don't think there ever has been such a situation where a company blows away every expectation and metric, guides to the stars yet the stock immediately goes dormant for weeks. It doesn't happen naturally. Common sense would tell you that the Banks can't possibly suppress a company for an ENTIRE QUARTER yet they are trying their hardest. That only gives me a bigger boner for what's to come. No Pun intended. 😂",$NVDA,reddit

Be wary, if we see another 7% dip it’d blow up your account. Would you maybe think of buying a longer date with higher call price for cheaper, if it drops another 7% you can roll position into a more aggressive one with the extra money you didn’t use on initial contract, on the flip side if it rockets you will only have the initial contribution in but idk I think that’s smarter.

The point is this: Unless you think that the US is going to balance its budget, the federal deficit is only going to go up. When the deficit goes up, the Fed has to create more dollars out of thin air and send them to the US Treasury to finance that deficit. Those dollars are then in the economy. But that doesn't automatically lead to inflation... what really matters is the velocity of that money (how often it's changing hands). To control velocity, the Fed fucks around with the short-term federal reserve rate (dogma is that higher rates slow the velocity and lower rates increase the velocity). But since the Fed has a dual mandate (stable prices--ie, steady 2% inflation--and maximum employment), they can't just jack up the interest rate as much as they want to get inflation back down. Me thinks that they will have to eventually settle on a higher centrally planned interest rate target (r-star) of 3-4%.

2325,"Tuesday, March 5, 2024 at 5:19:17 AM GMT+9",NVDA Call Options,"I made and lost a ton of money on options. My strategy in 2020 during Apple, Amazon and Netflix, Tesla were my go to options. I would pick a strike price 10% above current price 30 days out. I would sell the options once in the money and try to sell when I thought it was at a low for that day, I guessed right about 75 percent of the time. My account went from 63k to 1.8M in 4 months. The way to loose it back is to keep thinking that it’s always going to be a certain way. I messed up because I had a goal of 1.3 M and was to be out. Nope got greedy then up and down with the AMC stock and worse yet last year I had NVDA options bought them for 1 year out. The strike was 280, which was high back then. I got scared and sold the day before earnings then it went up. Really need to take classes online and read up then pick a cheap stock and do one option so you learn. Then when ready go for it and don’t look back and know that you can make 400k off a 100k option in One hour I did and you can loose it just as fast. Hope this helps Semper Fi",$NVDA,reddit

Let’s take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I’m sure it hurt investors at the time. And I’m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying “I shouldn’t have bought at all time highs when it’s so overvalued.” However, if they held for about 5 years until today they’re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I’d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn’t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you’re bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market.

AI applications aren't looking to use video cards per se, they aren't using pixels on a screen for calculation after all, they are looking for large numbers of relatively cheap vector CPUs, and right now graphics cards are essentially the only game in town for those. However there is not really a big technical barrier to including those vector processors on a CPU(most modern CPUs have some amount of vector units, just nowhere near the number that a GPU does). In fact vector based CPUs aren't really that new, the first Cray supercomputers were vector machines, earth simulator was one as well, and some Japanese chip maker have tried before to make them. The biggest issue is basically cost per unit. Up until the AI boom there wasn't really a lot of demand for such specialized CPUs and in an industry where there is a tremendous up front cost to making the CPUs limited market = very expensive per unit costs. If the AI boom has legs it will only be a matter of time before CPU manufacturers release CPUs with a lot more vector processing in them threatening Nvidia's dominance in this market. All that being said it will take a long time for not only the CPUs to come out but for the software to be ported and optimized for these new architectures.",$NVDA,reddit

For single-legged sell to open trades, it's more conservative to use the bid, so a 19.20 credit instead of 19.35. For the long leg, you did the right thing, you used ask of 15.10.
