Apples m chips are ridiculously better then anything intel or apple can throw at laptops without paying insane gamer money, and the x elite will prolly be the same, which btw Microsoft is betting on with windows 12.

678,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",I accepted Ivey AEO with BMOS but got off the queens commerce waitlist today. I want to pursue high finance or consulting. I like that Queens has a 4 year program. Whereas Ivey only has a 2 year one. I heard that Ivey ranks better in both… idk if that’s true tho. Any advice on which to pick would be greatly appreciated!!,$QCOM,reddit
679,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",Agree with post below. Decide how much you think you can maintain the 80 plus extras and if that provides 2 years of stress vs. a direct entry program. You are not in Ivey and if for whatever reason you don't meet the conditions will you regret not choosing Queens?,$QCOM,reddit
680,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",What's your average? Still on waiting list for Queens commerce,$QCOM,reddit
681,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",there's no job from ivey you can't get at queens. if you like queens go to queens!,$QCOM,reddit
682,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","I think this depends mainly on whether or not you like the idea of the 2+2 program at Ivey. I just finished my first year at Western so I can't speak much on recruiting but I think the 2+2 program has given me the opportunity to make many more interesting friends and take a wider breadth of classes compared to the more set Queens program. In the short term, this means that I'm way more engaged at uni and I assume in the long term when I start the HBA program I will be surrounded by a more intellectually diverse set of people which I really value.",$QCOM,reddit
683,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","Some of my peers don't like this though mainly because you have to maintain your average to keep AEO which is quite a bit of pressure and they don't have interests outside of business. If you relate to this, Queens might be the better choice.",$QCOM,reddit
684,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",I would suggest sticking with Ivey. It may be only 2 years but employment stats for Ivey are miles better than for Queens. They've got finance firms that exclusively recruit from Ivey as well.,$QCOM,reddit
685,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","I'd only suggest switching to QComm if you don't think you could keep an 80 average while doing ECs, if you can't afford their tuition or if there's some other reason you'd much prefer switching to QComm than Ivey like if Queens is closer so you can commute and you'd be really scared about moving out especially the point where it might effect your grades.",$QCOM,reddit
686,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",Definitely don't switch because you think it'd be better for career prospects.,$QCOM,reddit
687,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",average base salary for the queens link you sent uses 2018 figure and the difference is mainly due to the larger amount of people that choose to go into finance or consulting at ivey,$QCOM,reddit

689,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","I've been corrected by this comment. The Queens stats were out of date. Last year, the average salaries for Queens surpassed Ivey with the averages for Queens being $86k in the financial services industry and Ivey's being $81k.",$QCOM,reddit
690,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","As for exclusive firms that only hire from Ivey, I'd be surprised if that wasn't also the case for Queen's though I can't find anything on it so can't prove that. If you have a company you'd really like to work for, check the recruiters they list in the links I sent you and see if any recruit from only one of the schools.",$QCOM,reddit
691,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","So for finance, as of 2022 Queens is better than Ivey. However, for the past 5 years at least, Ivey had higher pay than QComm in finance. This just changed this year. So this could mean QComm is overtaking Ivey or it could be a one off thing. Regardless these are two incredible schools where you'll be able to succeed in the industry either way.",$QCOM,reddit
692,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?",So how I see it is this. If salary is the most important factor to you and you're worried that Queen's making more than Ivey grads this year was a one off thing then maybe go for Ivey.,$QCOM,reddit
693,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","Otherwise unless you like Western better because it's cheaper, closer, has a better vibe etc. I'd suggest going to Queen's. Either way you'll be able to succeed. In my personal opinion, I think this trend with Queen's making more than Ivey grads will be a long term thing. Though that's just a hunch and someone more educated can weigh in on this for me. With Queen's you don't have to worry as much about your ECs and keeping an 80% average. So that plus Queen's grads making more now than Ivey grads, I say go Queens.",$QCOM,reddit
694,"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 5:16:20 PM GMT+9","Just got off QCOM Waitlist, should I go?","Did you able to see the offer on OUAC to change your acceptance? Got the email but do not see the offer in OUAC.
