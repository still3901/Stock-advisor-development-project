He took over 8 or 9 years ago and has started the pivot towards automation/robotics - with purchase of Universal Robots and several others. They are using the strong cash flow from the chip testing business to fund their expansion of automation with the goal of becoming less of a cyclical company. I think its brilliant and have been holding and buying more since 2019. I am hoping they are going to ride the semiconductor/5G super cycle up and in a few years will expand the automation side to be a significant portion of their revenue (right now only about 10% of rev).,$TER,reddit
