If it can meet or surpass all estimates, I might think it will be a catalyst for a bounce back upwards tomorrow in the sector. TSM is the monopoly for high tier enterprise chip production, and they work with the above mention tickers. It is a small ecosystem for high tier. The only thing to gauge is how much the lower tier production will affect earnings calls this season.

Nur sehr selten finden relevante inhaltliche Auseinandersetzungen mit konträren Meinungen statt. Stimmen, die einen – medial behaupteten – gesellschaftlichen Konsens hinterfragen, werden wahlweise ignoriert, lächerlich gemacht oder gar ausgegrenzt. Inflationär bedient man sich zu diesem Zwecke verschiedener „Kampfbegriffe“ wie „Querdenker“, „Schwurbler“, „Klima-Leugner“, „Putin-Versteher“, „Gesinnungspazifist“ und anderen, mit denen versucht wird, Minderheiten mit abweichender Meinung zu diffamieren und mundtot zu machen.",$ENTG,reddit

For example, comparing the opening riff of the 5.1 mix here to the remaster here, there's a noticeable slide when the melody goes up to the E on the remaster that doesn't happen in the 5.1 mix. There's a similar nuance missing in the second riff, and others throughout the song I've noticed.

I see a lot of people asking and upvoting posts questioning whether to trust the theories/treatments offered by Alex Kikel. And before I go into it, let me first say that I am not against trying out new things or treatments. Testosterone therapy and other peptides can in many cases have a positive effect on an individual’s mental and physical well being. However, I think a defining characteristic of many PSSD, PFS, and PAS patients is the inability to respond to TRT and related treatments. I personally think that if you are to do experimental treatments, it should be based on sound science and conclusive evidence. The unfortunate thing about Kikel, is that he knows enough science to make intricate claims that require a lot of time and digging to validate. I hope I shed some light on this here, but I think it's best to view it like this: we have an individual who claims to have reversed dementia, cured cancer, treated PFS patients, and so much more. Do I say more? This is clearly someone who is in the business of deceiving individuals with scientific lingo and a confident salesmen like attitude. The worst part is there is no data he provides from any of his patients, so we really don't know what is going on with them.

He talks about this in a video on his Instagram. He starts off by stating that he guesses there is an overexpression of faulty androgen receptors. He believes this occurs through a process called alternative splicing (this is different then epigenetic modifications but I won't get into those here). What is alternate splicing? The simplified explanation of how your DNA gets turned into a protein (in this case the androgen receptor protein), goes as such; DNA goes to RNA goes to protein. In other words, DNA is first translated into RNA and from RNA gets modified before finally becoming mature mRNA ready for transcription into its protein. Alternative splicing is a system in which the RNA is spliced and rearranged, generating a new protein variant. Maybe some of you are aware of what are known as introns and exons. These are segments of DNA code with introns typically referred to as “junk” DNA that is spliced out, and exons being the DNA that actually codes for a protein and are spliced together. In the full length androgen receptor there are 8 exons which code for different domains of the androgen receptor. One of these domains is called the ligand binding domain (LBD). The ligand in this case are androgens (like testosterone) which bind to the LBD and exert their functions.",$ENTG,reddit

An antibody raised against the C-terminal amino acids 900–919 common to both AR types was used to simultaneously detect both isoforms. Western blot analysis of crude protein extracts revealed that AR-A and AR-B were present at low levels in males as well as females, independent of age (Fig. 1A). In both genders, in the presence of DHT, the proportion of AR-A varied between 20 and 30% of total AR. AR-A was not detectable using an antibody directed against the NH2-terminus of AR-B (Fig. 1B).

AR-B but not AR-A is responsible for the mitogenic stimulation of mesenchymal cells by androgens and AR-A inhibits the specific mitogenic function of androgen-activated AR-B in androgen receptor expressing tissues.

The conclusion of this study then seems to describe isoform A as having a dominant negative effect on isoform B. In other words, isoform A is already found in low abundance compared to isoform B and it's theorizes that isoform A acts like a break pedal, preventing isoform B from mediating it's effects in androgen responsive tissues. Not sure why we would want to upregulate an AR isoform with an inability to modulate expression of AR responsive genes either. It should also be noted that research in this area is limited.",$ENTG,reddit

Honestly I don't know what he is trying to say here. This is one of many examples where Kikel makes scientific sounding claims with little to no evidence to back it up and it's dizzying to wrap your head around. So let's just move on. It's very flawed to say the least. What I will say is this, alternative splicing does not cause codon based changes to occur to the underlying DNA code and taking DHB will not drive the androgen receptor to alter its genetic make up either. Again, from what I have read the N terminus is essential for normal AR function, but there may be something I am missing and there could always be more research done.",$ENTG,reddit
1380,"Monday, December 18, 2023 at 5:12:10 AM GMT+9",The Alex Kikel Androgen Receptor / DHB Analysis No One Asked For,"Additionally, while A and B are well known, I can’t find anything referring to the ""transmutative C"" variant he speaks of. Regardless, what is important is that much of the studied variants outside of variants A and B are found in cancer cells due to dysfunction in various cellular processes. This can lead to differences in alternative splicing and in many cases dysfunction of DNA repair processes leading to multiple accumulated mutations to the underlying DNA code. For example, it’s been found in prostate cancer that some individuals receiving antiandrogen treatments will accumulate mutations in the ligand binding domain resulting in these antiandrogens no longer binding and blocking androgen function. In some cases, these mutations even render these drugs as agonists, leading to the drug progressing their cancer. To give an example of splicing dysfunction in cancer cells, it’s been observed that some AR variants exist with truncated ligand binding domains, allowing them to act in the absence of androgens. This is what’s typically referred to as castration resistant prostate cancer. It’s called this because castration (removing androgens like testosterone) has no effect on the AR’s ability to function and continue the progression of cancer. These are notoriously deadly cancers because they don’t respond to antiandrogen treatments.",$ENTG,reddit
1381,"Monday, December 18, 2023 at 5:12:10 AM GMT+9",The Alex Kikel Androgen Receptor / DHB Analysis No One Asked For,"So we know that alternative splicing is an event following translation of DNA to RNA, where different coding regions known as exons are spliced, rearranged, or even left out in a variety of combinations. However, AR variants are mostly found in cancer cells and A isoform has not been shown to be a prominent or active isoform compared to the full length B isoform. At least not from my limited reading. But you might be wondering if there is an overexpression of faulty variants in PFS patients. After all, there are A and B variants found in healthy individuals and Kikel has described a possible 3rd. Well, you might be aware of a study done on PFS patients called Differential Gene Expression in Post-Finasteride Syndrome Patients. This study took tissue samples from the genitals of PFS and control patients and extracted the RNA using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit. This is important because when looking at gene expression you want to take a look at the RNA present in the tissue to determine what is (possibly) being actively made into protein. From here they used the Agilent Array (8X) chip (Human GE V2 Array, 8 £ 60K). What these numbers mean is that there are 8 identical arrays which contain 60,000 probes. According to Agilent's website, these probes consist of 26,083 unique genes and 30,606 unique long non-coding RNA, which is a sequence of RNA that does not code for a protein. These probes work by binding to transcripts whose sequence is complementary to the probe sequence. For example a gene that codes AAAA would bind the probe AAAA and a gene that codes GGGG would not (this is a simplified example). Unfortunately, I can’t find the specific kit used in the study on Agilent's website, it’s likely they now offer new kits. But this is relatively common among biotech companies to update products and we will assume the probes used for the androgen receptor in the V2 array are similar to the probes in the V3 kit. After downloading the V3 kit genelist from their website, I searched for the AR probe. This is what comes up, A_23_P113111 NM_000044 AR androgen receptor ref|NM_000044|ref|NM_001011645|ens|ENST00000396043|ens|ENST00000612452 Homo sapiens androgen receptor (AR), transcript variant 1, mRNA [NM_000044]. As you can see this is probing for transcript variant 1 which is, you guessed it, the full length androgen receptor (B isoform). Not a variant. It is worth noting however, that transcript variant 2 is also listed (NM_001011645) which is the isoform with a truncated N-terminus. According to the Agilent website, probes are manufactured using Agilent 60-mer SurePrint Technology. Basically, they are 60 nucleotides in length. I went ahead and signed up for an account on Agilents eArray website and was able to search for the probes specific sequence. Here is what came up:",$ENTG,reddit

It's absolutely possible that the RNA transcripts isolated from these patients could still undergo alternative splicing to yield different isoforms. I personally don't believe that's the case but the only way to find out is to design an experiment to prove it. However, I think if there was significant overexpression of different isoforms, there might not be as much signal coming from the probes via hybridization of RNA. This is just speculation though. I think it is also worth saying that if someone really wanted to know, they could do RNA sequencing to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the entire transcriptome of the cell.

I know that many individuals don't have a scientific background and it can be easy to believe anyone who talks ""scientifically"", and that's ok.

Going back to my intro again, I think it's best to see it for what it is; Kikel claims to have cured everything from cancer, to dementia, to PFS, and much more. It's silly to believe one man with no scientific background can do so much. Additionally, it can be dangerous to draw such big conclusions without solid evidence. Maybe DHB does work, but in a different mechanism. For example, if I claimed PFS was caused by a mutation in gene ""U"" people might look to fix this without understanding the consequences if it turns out to not be the cause of PFS.
